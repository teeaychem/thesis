Almost every file related to my thesis written for a philosophy (symbolic systems track) PhD at Stanford.

The thesis itself is in the folder called 'Ability'.

I don't recommend looking at this, but as the final product is publicly available, I think the history (with all the dead-ends and scrapped ideas) should also be available.
