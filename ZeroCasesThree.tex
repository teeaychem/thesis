\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

At present, this motivation is intrinsic.
There are few hints in the literature, but nothing developed in significant detail.
So, the idea and how it can be used to understand phenomena.

\begin{itemize}
\item Present the basic case.
\item Analysis, features.
\item Outline two other cases.
\item Discussion.
\end{itemize}


\section{Generic and singular}
\label{sec:generic-singular}

Generic proposition is about a property.
In the chess example it's whether the game belongs to the class of games for which a winning strategy exists.

Singular propositions are about individuals, whether there is a winning strategy for the game.

Difference in focus, 


\section{Sketching out a framework}
\label{sec:sketch-out-fram}

\begin{note}
  The intuitive idea I've been working with is that in the chess scenario the agent gets information from their companion that a winning strategy exists, and that the agent is confident that they are able to reason to the existence of a winning strategy.
  And, further, that there is a distinction in the kind of reasons that the agent has for being confident that there is a winning strategy.
  Roughly, evidence based on the reliability of the companion on the one hand, and what the agent would reason to on the other.

  Below is an attempt to sketch out what I think the agent's reasoning may be in some detail.
\end{note}

To start, \citeauthor{Pryor:2018aa}'s distinction between categorical and hypothetical justification is quite nice.
\citeauthor{Pryor:2018aa} explains the distinction as follows:

\begin{quote}
  When you're justified in some beliefs A that obviously support a conclusion B, I'll say you have categorical justification for both A and B.
  When the justification for A is removed but you retain your (now unjustified) beliefs in A, then I'll say that they merely hypothetically justify or support having belief B.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor[126]{Pryor:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

It may not be particular clear from the passage quoted, but categorical justification is more-or-less evidential justification, and hypothetical justification is more-or-less attitudinal justification.
The preceding passage clarifies this.

\begin{quote}
  The old, familiar kind of normative relation gets called ``reasons rationality'' or ``evidential norms'' (though that label doesn’t generalize well to the practical case, with which these discussions also engage).
  I've sometimes called it ``categorical normativity'', with the idea of opposing it to ``conditional'' or ``hypothetical normativity'' on the other side.
  The newer kind of normative relation posited here gets called ``structural'' or ``attitudinal rationality'', or ``normative'' or ``rational requirements''.
  Some authors use terms like ``coherence requirements''.
  There is a broad tendency to use terms like ``rationality'' and ``coherence'' in reference to this second kind of normativity, though other authors use ``rationality'' to refer to the whole genus of which we’re now distinguishing two varieties.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor[126]{Pryor:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

It seems to me that \citeauthor{Pryor:2018aa}'s use of `categorical' and `hypothetical' justification capture the relevant distinction that I'm after, without presupposing too much about reasoning.
Roughly, the agent has categorical justification that a winning strategy exists given their confidence that they can settle on an answer to whether and winning strategy and the state of the board and the rules of chess given their past interactions between the agent and the companion.
Further, given the state of the board and the agent's grasp of the rules of chess, if the agent were to reason and settle on an answer to whether there is a winning strategy then the agent would have, at least, hypothetical justification, as this reasoning would be based on attitudes that the agent has without any additional information.
Furthermore, the agent could also be confident that this hypothetical justification is categorical justification, from their (or the companions) previous demonstrations of winning strategies once these have claimed to be found.

\begin{note}
As an aside, \citeauthor{Pryor:2018aa} notes the possibility of interaction between categorical and hypothetical norms, but as \citeauthor{Pryor:2018aa} is interested in cases of hypothetical defeat, no more is mentioned.

\begin{quote}
  My view is that hypothetical and categorical norms can combine to generate more hypothetical norms.
  That is, if attitudes A hypothetically support believing B, and your evidence is such as to make B categorically support C, then---even if you don't in fact infer from B to C---that can be enough to make A also hypothetically support C.
  But your actual attitudes towards B and C may interfere with this in complex ways.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[128]{Pryor:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

This contrasts with \citeauthor{Fogal:2019aa}'s assumption that the parallel pressures of substantive (categorical) and structural (hypothetical) rational do not interact.
(\citeauthor{Fogal:2019aa} notes this contrast to \citeauthor{Pryor:2018aa} in a footnote following the quoted passage.)

\begin{quote}
  I also take substantive rationality and structural rationality to be autonomous in the further sense of failing to directly interact with each other.
  For instance, if there’s substantial justificatory pressure to believe \emph{p} (for example, you have lots of evidence supporting \emph{p}), this pressure isn't in any way reduced simply because you happen to believe something obviously incompatible with \emph{p}.
  Your mere \emph{belief} doesn't, by itself, make any difference to what your evidence supports.
  Although I don’t have a tidy argument for such claims, I take them to be plausible enough to adopt as working hypotheses, and hence assume that there are interactions between pressures of the same kind but not interactions between pressures of different kinds.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor[27]{Fogal:2019aa})}
\end{quote}

This suggests that there's potentially some interest in the kinds of cases I've been thinking about, but I'm not exactly sure on what to say here beyond noting the connexion.
\end{note}

I do not think that the distinction between categorical and hypothetical pressure is enough to fully sketch out the scenario, however.
For it seems there is a second distinction between \emph{general} and \emph{specific} justification that is relevant.
Intuitively, this is a distinction between probabilistic and non-probabilistic justification.
To illustrate.
First, it seems that the agent has general justification for thinking that a winning strategy exists based on their interaction with the companion because they draw on information independent from the current game of chess to establish this (that is, the agent's past experience with settling on answers to similar looking boards and the agent's past experience with the reliability of the companion).
Second, it seems that if the agent were to settle on an answer to whether there was a winning strategy then the agent would have specific justification given the state of the board and their grasp of the rules of chess, and would not need to rely on past experience or their interaction with the companion (except, perhaps, with regards to their confidence that they do grasp the rules of chess).

With the distinction between categorical and hypothetical justification, and between general and specific justification, there are four combinations of justification that can be considered, and I think three of these are relevant:

\begin{enumerate}
\item General categorical
\item Specific hypothetical
\item Specific categorical
\end{enumerate}

The goal is to show that the agent has general categorical support for the existence of a winning strategy based on their interaction with the companion and their confidence that they can settle on an answer to whether a winning strategy exists.
Further, this provides the agent with general categorical justification that by settling on an answer to whether there is a winning strategy the agent would have specific hypothetical justification for confidence that a winning strategy exists.
And, finally, the agent has general categorical support for their specific hypothetical that a winning strategy exists being specific categorical support.

The distinction between the agent's (potential) specific hypothetical and specific categorical support is made to mark the difference between what would follow from the agent's attitude and what follows as a matter of fact.

\subsection{Notation}
\label{sec:notation}

To sketch out the agent's reasoning I abbreviate the different kinds of support with a arrow marked by to letters, one above the arrow and the other below the arrow.
These are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\phi \xlongrightarrow[c]{g} \psi\) = \(\phi\) provides general categorical support for \(\psi\).
\item \(\phi \xlongrightarrow[h]{s} \psi\) = \(\phi\) provides specific hypothetical support for \(\psi\).
\item \(\phi \xlongrightarrow[c]{s} \psi\) = \(\phi\) provides specific categorical support for \(\psi\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Argument in full}
\label{sec:argument-full}

The initial three premises all note general categorical support that the agent recognises.

First, that the state of the board and the rules of chess provide general categorical support that the agent can settle the question of whether there is a winning strategy.
The support here is general and categorical because it relies on past experience and does not depend only on the attitudes that the agent has.

Second, that the agent being able to settle the question of whether there is a winning strategy provides general categorical support for the reliability of the companion.

Third, the reliability of the companion provides general categorical support for the existence of a winning strategy.
Here, the support is listed as general and categorical because it depends on the reliability of the companion.
The agent may have specific categorical support for the proposition that the companion answered `yes' to the question of whether a winning strategy exists, but the proposition of interest is whether a winning strategy in fact exists.

\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{arg:bAr-settle} Board and rules \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) Agent can settle.
\item\label{arg:settle-reliable} Agent can settle \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) Companion is reliable.
\item\label{arg:reliable-ws} Companion is reliable \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) Winning strategy exists.
\end{enumerate}

The fourth premise is more complex, and states that if there is general categorical support for a winning strategy given the state of the board and the rules of chess, then if the agent is able to settle on an answer to whether a winning strategy exists, this provides general categorical support for there being specific hypothetical support for a winning strategy given the state of the board and the rules of chess.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item\label{arg:gcWS+settle-shWS} [Board and rules \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) Winning strategy exists] \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) [Agent can settle \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) [Board and rules \(\xlongrightarrow[h]{s}\) Winning strategy exists]].
\end{enumerate}

Intuitively, if the agent is confident that a winning strategy exists, and the agent is also confident that they are able to settle the question of whether a winning strategy exists, then the agent is confident that they are able to reason from the board and the rules of chess to the existence of a winning strategy.

This conditional does not state that the agent is confident that they are correct in their reasoning to the existence of a winning strategy.
However, the agent is confident that when they have been correct when they have had specific hypothetical support for the existence of a winning strategy.
The support for this is general and categorical, and it ranges over previous games, hence the agent has general categorical support for their specific hypothetical support being specific categorical support.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item\label{arg:shWS-scWS} [Board and rules \(\xlongrightarrow[h]{s}\) Winning strategy exists] \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) [Board and rules \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{s}\) Winning strategy exists].
\end{enumerate}

These are the five initial premises.

The agent can then piece together the initial three premises to obtain general categorical support that there is a winning strategy based on the state of the board and the rules of chess.
The specific reasoning used here needs some work, but the thought is simply that the agent is piecing together what they have given the initial three premises, and not that the agent is establishing independent general categorical support for the existence of a winning strategy given the state of the board and the rules of chess --- I do recognise that the way this is presented is likely misleading, though.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item\label{gcBS-R} Board and rules \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) Companion is reliable. \hfill (by \ref{arg:bAr-settle} and \ref{arg:settle-reliable})
\item\label{gcBS-WS} Board and rules \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) Winning strategy exists. \hfill (by \ref{gcBS-R} and \ref{arg:reliable-ws})
\end{enumerate}

Continuing, the agent reasons from the general categorical support that a winning strategy exists to general categorical confidence that there is specific hypothetical support for a winning strategy given the state of the board and the rules of chess.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Agent can settle \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) [Board and rules \(\xlongrightarrow[h]{s}\) Winning strategy exists].\linebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill(by \ref{arg:shWS-scWS} and \ref{gcBS-WS})
\end{enumerate}

Again, the presentation is misleading here, as the above premise is not arrived at via `detachment'.
Rather, the general categorical support for a winning strategy given the state of the board and the rules of chess is being placed in the background.

Still, something like this is the conclusion of interest.
That is, the agent's reasoning about the categorical support available given their interaction with the agent leads to agent to recognise that they have (at least) specific hypothetical support for the existence of a winning strategy.

Using the final premise, this is then strengthened to include confidence that not only is there specific hypothetical support, but that this support is also categorical.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item\label{p:?} Agent can settle \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{g}\) [Board and rules \(\xlongrightarrow[c]{s}\) Winning strategy exists]
\end{enumerate}

General categorical support here cannot be avoided, as the agent only has general categorical support that specific hypothetical support is also specific categorical support.
For the relation of support between the state of the board and the rules of chess to provide specific categorical support for the existence of a winning strategy, the agent would need to demonstrate that the companion can win no matter what the agent does.

As things stand, the agents confidence that there is specific hypothetical (and specific categorical) support for the existence of a winning strategy given the state of the board and the rules of chess depends on the agent's confidence that they are able to settle.

The specific hypothetical support is of primary interest, though the agent's confidence that this is also specific categorical support is important, as the agent is confident that they would have support for a winning strategy if they were to settle whether a winning strategy exists by reasoning from the board and the rules of chess, and the agent is confident that they would be correct in so doing.

Though I'm not sure it helps, here's a diagram of the key relations.

\label{fig:dynamics}
\end{figure}

Roughly, there's a straightforward general categorical route to the agent's confidence that a winning strategy exists, but this also provides general categorical support for specific hypothetical support that a winning strategy exists.

\subsection{Notes}
\label{sec:notes}

So, what's important here is that there's a different \emph{type} of support available to the agent.
Namely, specific hypothetical (and likely categorical) support as opposed to general categorical support.

The role of the companion is to provide the agent with general categorical support that there is a winning strategy given the state of the board and the rules of chess.
And, after the agent establishes that there is general categorical support for a winning strategy given the state of the board and the rules of chess, it is this together with the agent's confidence that they are able to settle the question of whether there is a winning strategy which provides general categorical support for there being specific hypothetical support for the existence of a winning strategy given the board and the rules of chess.

The importance of the companion is, then, limited.
For example, there is potential for the companion to be providing testimony to the agent.
Yet, the scenario could be recast such that the companion is a somewhat limited computer program or any other instantiation of a random variable with the appropriate statistical properties (i.e.\ agreement with the agent's pattern of settling).
Of course, it may be the case that testimony is provided by the only plausible instantiations of random variables with the appropriate statistical properties, but even if testimony can be appealed to, I doubt that this resolves the puzzle.
For, even if the companion provides testimony that a winning strategy exists, it remains the case that the agent is confident that they are able to reason to the existence of a winning strategy independently of the companions (assumed) testimony.


\section{Inspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis}
\label{sec:second-case}

\begin{note}
  Below is a variation of the chess example that needs a little more work, but which I quite like.
  In short, Morse and Lewis are police officers who share the same powers of deduction and evidence.
  Lewis is a sergeant to Morse's role as inspector, but no longer wishes to enact Morse's commands.

  Lewis is the agent, Morse the companion, and Morse provides Lewis with the information that someone is a suspect given the evidence available to both Morse and Lewis.
  Lewis notices the suspect, and has no interest in approaching the person merely on the basis on Morse thinking that the person is a suspect.
  However, Lewis would approach the person if Lewis thought they were a suspect.
  Hence, given Morse's information about what Lewis could reason to, Lewis ends up approaching the person as a suspect.
\end{note}

Unlike Sherlock and Watson or Marple and a companion, Morse and Lewis are equally matched.\nolinebreak
\footnote{There is a lot that could be said about Morse and Lewis, but for background here a relevant detail is that the dynamic between Morse and Lewis is that of chance and privilege.}

Morse and Lewis have been working on a case together, share the same capacity to reason from evidence, and have examined the same evidence.
Lewis, as a sergeant, has been burdened with other tasks, and Morse is being recalcitrant.
In addition, Lewis has no interest in following Morse's orders.
The police stated is well staffed, and if Morse needs something to be done, and officer (other than Lewis) can be found.
However, Lewis will not refuse to perform a task if More thinks it needs to be done, Lewis' position is against performing a task that Lewis does not recognise as required by their role as a sergeant.

Lewis notices a message on their answer machine when returning home after work.
The message is from Morse who, given the lack of any new information, has been thinking about the case Morse and Lewis have been working on and thinks that it would be worthwhile for Person X to be brought in for questioning, but Morse does not explain why.
The unstated implication of Morse's message is that Lewis should bring Person X in for question tomorrow.
Lewis is confident that it would be worthwhile for Person X to be bought in for questioning, and that Lewis would arrive at this conclusion were they not so overburdened.
Still, bringing Person X in for questioning is a task that any officer could perform, so Lewis is under no pressure to seek Person X --- so tomorrow Lewis will explain to Morse that there are other officers at the police station.

Lewis' position, then, recognises that Morse thinks it is worthwhile for Person X to be brought in for questioning and that Lewis is in a position to recognise that it would be worthwhile for Person X to be bought in for questioning given the information available to Lewis.

The next morning, Lewis is on their way to work and notices Person X in the corner shop.
One the one hand, Lewis can radio in to the police station the location of a suspect that Morse would like to question.
One the other hand, Lewis is confident that they would have, were they to have thought more about the case, formed interest in questioning Person X themselves and Lewis recognises a requirement to themselves bring in for questioning suspects that they would like to question.
So, one the one hand Lewis' requirement is merely to inform the station that Person X has been sighted, while on the other hand Lewis' requirement would be to approach Person X themselves were they recognise the interest in questioning Person X.

Not much thinking is required, and Lewis approaches Person X, frustrated that they have not yet put together when they are interested in questioning Person X, but confident that they are not merely carrying out a task Morse thinks needs to be done.

\section{Middlemarch}
\label{sec:middlemarch}

\begin{note}
  I searched through Middlemarch for passages mentioning Pianos, and what follows is the only passage that seemed similar to the kind of cases I've been thinking about.

  However, I'm not sure that this quite works.
  For, it's not clear that Rosamond has any reason to think that Ladislaw's coming will require Lydgate to make plans to move to London.
  Instead, it seems as though Rosamond desires to go to London, but needs some cause for this to happen and Ladislaw's coming could be a cause, and (in a very Humean way) the constant conjunction of these two things in Rosamond's mind lead Rosamond to establish a relation of cause and effect that isn't supported by any particular reasons (though as Eliot notes, this kind of thing wouldn't be unique to Rosamond).

  Perhaps there's more to the story, though!
  It could be that Ladislaw is interested in Rosamond, Rosamond recognises this, but hasn't been able to identify the particular dynamic between Ladislaw and Lydgate which would lead Lydgate to make plans for London, but is confident given her general understanding of interpersonal relations that such a dynamic exists.
  Still, after reading through a few synopsis I'm not sure that this is the case\dots at the very least Rosamond here provides a nice contrast case.
\end{note}

\begin{quote}
  The next day Lydgate had to go to Brassing, and told Rosamond that he should be away until the evening.
  Of late she had never gone beyond her own house and garden, except to church, and once to see her papa, to whom she said,
  ``If Tertius goes away, you will help us to move, will you not, papa?
  I suppose we shall have very little money.
  I am sure I hope some one will help us.''
  And Mr.\ Vincy had said,
  ``Yes, child, I don't mind a hundred or two.
  I can see the end of that.''
  With these exceptions she had sat at home in languid melancholy and suspense, fixing her mind on Will Ladislaw's coming as the one point of hope and interest, and associating this with some new urgency on Lydgate to make immediate arrangements for leaving Middlemarch and going to London, till she felt assured that the coming would be a potent cause of the going, without at all seeing how.
  This way of establishing sequences is too common to be fairly regarded as a peculiar folly in Rosamond.
  And it is precisely this sort of sequence which causes the greatest shock when it is sundered: for to see how an effect may be produced is often to see possible missings and checks; but to see nothing except the desirable cause, and close upon it the desirable effect, rids us of doubt and makes our minds strongly intuitive.
  That was the process going on in poor Rosamond, while she arranged all objects around her with the same nicety as ever, only with more slowness---or sat down to the piano, meaning to play, and then desisting, yet lingering on the music stool with her white fingers suspended on the wooden front, and looking before her in dreamy ennui.
  Her melancholy had become so marked that Lydgate felt a strange timidity before it, as a perpetual silent reproach, and the strong man, mastered by his keen sensibilities towards this fair fragile creature whose life he seemed somehow to have bruised, shrank from her look, and sometimes started at her approach, fear of her and fear for her rushing in only the more forcibly after it had been momentarily expelled by exasperation.\linebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(Chapter LXXVII.)}
\end{quote}


\begin{quote}
  Rosamond played admirably.
  Her master at Mrs. Lemon's school (close to a county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church and castle) was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be found in our provinces, worthy to compare with many a noted Kapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of musical celebrity.
  Rosamond, with the executant's instinct, had seized his manner of playing, and gave forth his large rendering of noble music with the precision of an echo.
  It was almost startling, heard for the first time.
  A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from Rosamond's fingers; and so indeed it was, since souls live on in perpetual echoes, and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an originating activity, if it be only that of an interpreter.
  Lydgate was taken possession of, and began to believe in her as something exceptional.

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa}'s account of correctly responding to reasons seems a plausible account of what the agent fails to do in the chess scenario.
  For, the state of the board, the agent's grasp of the rules, and the agent's confidence that they can settle on whether there is a winning strategy suggest that the agent possesses reasons to believe that a winning strategy exists.

  However, as \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} ties correctly responding to reasons to being rational, the agent in the chess example is irrational.
  Further, the agent is irrational even if they merely reason to general categorical support that there is a winning strategy given their confidence that they can settle on whether there is a winning strategy and the reliability of the companion, as it seems the agent possesses specific hypothetical (and categorical) reasons to believe that a winning strategy exists.

  \nolinebreak

\end{quote}

Strictly speaking, \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} endorses `Possession', on the basis that condition \ref{lord:posession:epistemic} of `Composite Possession' is a background condition on possession.

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Possession}: What it is for agent \emph{A} to possess reason \emph{r} to \(\phi\) provided by fact \emph{f} is for \emph{A} to be in a position to manifest knowledge about how to use \emph{r} to \(\phi\).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Possession Enables Rational Routing}: If \emph{A} possesses \emph{r} as a sufficient reason to \(\phi\), then there is a route that \emph{A} can take to \emph{ex post} rational \(\phi\)-ing on the basis of \emph{r}.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[100]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

Key idea is that \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} argues for is that the epistemic condition is insufficient as an account of reason possession and that the practical condition fills this gap.

This, seems right, to the extent that we focus on the agent's understanding of the board and the rules of chess it does not seem that the agent possess a reason for confidence that there is a winning strategy.
Instead, it is the combination (or the fulfilment of the background condition) of the agent's understanding of the board and the rules of chess \emph{with} the agent's confidence that the are in a position to use the board and their grasp of the rules of chess which suggests that the agent possesses a reason independently of the companion's answer for confidence that there is a winning strategy.

  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[139]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Manifest}: What it is for \emph{A} to \(\phi\) for a normative reason \emph{r} is for \emph{A}'s \(\phi\)-ing to be a manifestation of \emph{A}'s knowledge about how to use \emph{r} as the reason it is to \(\phi\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[139]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

\citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} takes `Manifest' to be an account of what it is to react for a normative reason.
\citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} argues, however, is that rationality is guarantee only if an agent's reactions are supported by sufficiently strong normative reasons.
(\citeyear[141]{Lord:2018aa})

\citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} provides the following account of reacting to a sufficient normative reason.

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Sufficient Normative}: \emph{A} \(\phi\)s for a sufficient normative reason \emph{r} just in case \emph{A} \(\phi\)s in virtue of the fact that \emph{r} is a sufficient normative reason to \(\phi\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[142]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

The key here is the `in virtue of' relation, understood through two requirements of an agent's dispositions.

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Sufficient Normative–Sustaining}: \emph{A} \(\phi\)-s for a sufficient normative reason \emph{r} if \emph{A} is disposed to cease \(\phi\)-ing when \emph{r} ceases to be a sufficient normative reason to \(\phi\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[142]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Sufficient Normative–Production}: \emph{A} \(\phi\)s for a sufficient normative reason \emph{r} if \emph{A}'s \(\phi\)-ing is the manifestation of a disposition to \(\phi\) when the fact that constitutes \emph{r} is a sufficient normative reason to \(\phi\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[142]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

\citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} suggests that the disjunction of sustaining and manifesting forms a necessary and sufficient condition fir reacting for a sufficient normative reason.

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Sufficient Normative–Fleshed Out}: \emph{A} \(\phi\)s for a sufficient normative reason \emph{r} just in case \emph{A}'s \(\phi\)-ing is sustained or produced by the fact that \emph{r} is a sufficient normative reason to \(\phi\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[143]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

For \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} reacting to sufficient normative reasons is understood in terms of know-how, leading to:

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Manifest Sufficient}: What it is for \emph{A} to \(\phi\) for a sufficient normative reason to \(\phi\) is for \emph{A} to manifest knowledge about how to use \emph{r} as the sufficient reason it is to \(\phi\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[143]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

This, then completes \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa}'s account of \emph{ex post} rationality.

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Correctly Responding}: What it is for \emph{A}'s \(\phi\)-ing to be \emph{ex post} rational is for \emph{A} to possess sufficient reason \emph{S} to \(\phi\) and for \emph{A}'s \(\phi\)-ing to be a manifestation of knowledge about how to use \emph{S} as sufficient reason to \(\phi\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[143]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

So, in \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa}'s terminology it seems the agent is in a position to be \emph{ex post} rational confidence that there is a winning strategy given the board and the agent's grasp of the rules of chess.
However, the agent does not manifest the appropriate knowledge of how to use the board and the rules of chess to demonstrate the existence of a winning strategy, and hence the agent is not \emph{ex post} rational.

This seems plausible to me.
Of course, there are details that matter, but in broad strokes it is the agent's failure to reason from the board and their grasp of the rules which is striking, and if the agent were to respond to their possessed reasons by reasoning to a winning strategy, then there doesn't seem to be anything particularly interesting about the scenario.
Still, if the agent does not correctly respond to the possessed reasons for a winning strategy, then the agent is not rational on \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} account, and this is somewhat unsatisfying.



A further question is whether, on \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa}'s account, there is pressure for the agent to believe that there is a winning strategy based on their confidence that they can settle on an answer to whether there is a winning strategy.
\citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} notes three relevant principles.

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Belief Schema}: If the set of reasons you possess decisively supports \emph{p}, then you are rationally required to believe that \emph{p}.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[28]{Lord:2018aa})}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Closure Transmission}: If the reasons you possess decisively support \emph{p} and the reasons you possess decisively support if \emph{p} then \emph{q}, then the reasons you possess decisively support \emph{q}.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Reasons-Coherence, Closure}: If you are closure incoherent, then you are not correctly responding to all of the reasons you possess.
\end{quote}

\citeauthor{Lord:2018aa}'s account of possession limits the scope of Closure/Coherence, as the agent must be able to manifest knowledge about how to use the reason.
This means that it doesn't apply to cases such as the preface paradox, as the condition does not require coherence between arbitrary collections of attitudes.
Still, this does not exclude the chess case, as plausibly it is the case that the reasons the agent possesses do decisively support believing that there is a winning strategy.

The relevant problem is that the agent should recognise that they do not satisfy coherence by `merely' having the required attitude.
Coherence, on \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa}'s view, is a result of correct responsiveness, and so does not seem as though the agent should worry about closure if they recognise that they have not correctly responded to the reasons in their possession.

So, it does not seem that, on \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa}'s account the agent is under pressure to believe that there is a winning strategy given the state of the board and the rules of chess, as the relevant form of irrationality is the failure of the agent to correctly respond to the reasons that they possess.

In part, this can be seen by \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa}'s argument for Reasons-Coherence, Closure.

\begin{quote}
  Reasons-Coherence, Closure is true because it will either be true that you possess decisive reason to believe \emph{p}, decisive reason to believe if \emph{p} then \emph{q} and thus by Closure Transmission possess decisive reason to believe \emph{q}, or you won't.
  If you do possess decisive reason to believe \emph{p}, decisive reason to believe if \emph{p} then \emph{q}, then you'll possess decisive reason to believe \emph{q}, and thus you are irrational when closure incoherent because you don't believe \emph{q}.
  If you lack decisive reason to believe \emph{p} or lack decisive reason to believe if \emph{p} then \emph{q}, then you will be irrational when closure incoherent because you hold one of those beliefs and you are rationally required not to.
  Either way, you will be irrational when closure incoherent.
\end{quote}

Here, \citeauthor{Lord:2018aa} identifies the irrationality of being closure incoherent in terms of failing to correctly respond to possessed reasons.
Therefore, as the agent has not (yet, at least) responding to their possessed reasons in the chess scenario, the agent is irrational, and moreover there is no clear explanation for why the agent would (incorrectly) respond to their possessed reasons as there is no route to rationality other than by correctly responding to their reasons.
