% \item The purpose of the talk is to convince you of these two claims.
% \item Putting the positive claim to work will be left for some other time, perhaps the Q\&A!
% \item My goal is establish the positive claim so that you can have some fun putting it to work.
% \item I want \emph{you} to apply the positive claim to your favoured theory or model of practical reasoning and show \emph{me} the interesting stuff it can do!
% \item Though, so long as things go okay today, I'll do \emph{some} of this work in the thesis\dots

% \begin{itemize}
% \item I will suggest a few ways in which the perspective could be useful at the end of the talk, but the focus of the talk is on the basics.
% \item In most cases of an agent settling on a means both conditions could be argued for.
% \item So, showing that it is always the case that agent takes there to be a means-end relation and showing that in some cases the agent taking there to be a means-end relation does important work is a way to establish the explanatory potential of the alternative link.

  \frametitle{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Goal has been to highlight that an agent taking there to be a means-end relation is always available as an explanatory resource, and to motivate the use of this resource by showing that a recognised resource fails in certain cases.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item There are cases in which a rational agent is unable to settle on a means by reason via a means-end relation.
    \item In all cases, if a rational agent settles on a means the agent must take there to be a supporting means-end relation.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Provides a way to understand Oblique.
  \item What use can \schemaName{Taking} be put to as an explanatory resource?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reasoning about means-end relations is important!
  \item Reasoning via a means-end relation allows an agent to `audit' the relation.
  \item The relevant `audit' doesn't need to occur when settling on an action (in part) as a means.
    % \begin{itemize}
    % \item It must be the case that the means supports achieving the end in some way.
    % \end{itemize}
    % \item Commitment to the end: If the end has a role in certain instances, then there's questions about whether it should also have a role in other instances of practical reasoning.

%   Professor Oblique is reasoning about an end, and considers a means (initially to some end) on the basis of a persistent object, but is unable to reason from the means to the end.
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Three parameters to vary:
%     \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Whether the agent is able to reason about the end.
%     \item Whether the agent is able to reason about the means-end relation.
%     \item Whether the agent is able to recall information about the end/means/means-end relation `internally' or `externally'
%     \end{enumerate}
%   \item Example questions:
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Are there cases in which an agent recognises a means, but is unable to recall what the means is an end to, but would easily be able to reason from the end to the means were they able to recall the end?
