\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Oblique settled without satisfying `Reasoning'}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Oblique settles on purchasing the item as a means to some end.
  \item Oblique's outstretched hand provides information that purchasing the item was something they settled on.
  \item Oblique is unable to reason via a means-end relation from an end they have which supports purchasing the item.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Obliqe is unable to reason about the relevant end.
    \item Without the relevant end Oblique is unable to reason about means-end relations from the end to the means.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Oblique is rationally permitted to settle on the means}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Oblique's outstretched hand provides information that purchasing the item was something they settled on.
  \item Two arguments:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Purchasing the item is supported by a means-end relation.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item If Oblique settled on the purchasing the item, this was supported by a means-end relation and some end.
      \item So, purchasing the item was supported by a means-end relation and some end Oblique had.
      \item And, as Oblique only lost consciousness for a moment they reason that the relevant means-end relation and end continue to hold.
      \end{itemize}
    \item It seems asburd to send Oblique all the way home to look at the shopping list they left on their fridge.

  \item The agent has enough information to determine that an act would be worthwhile as a means to some end.
  \item The agent does not have sufficient information to determine how a means-end relation from the end would support the means.
  \item The agent has sufficient information to determine that a supporting means-end relation from the end they have holds.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Is there an intermediate position which is more informative about the role of means-end relations in practical reasoning?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item[\hand] Why think that in cases where an agent \emph{can} reason from an end to a means that the agent \emph{must} settle on the means they are able to reason to?
  \end{itemize}

  Here's something of an inductive argument (needs work).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Settling on means requires an appropriate means-end relation.
\item Sometimes an agent may have a `bad grasp' on the relevant means-end relations or recognise their inability to adequately reason from ends to means.
\item Sometimes it is permissible for an agent to rely on means-end relations they are unable to reason though and hence settle on a means that they are unable to reason to.
\end{enumerate}

    After dinner work and enjoyable meals.

    A single glass of wine makes the meal more enjoyable and does not obstruct later work.

    However, after the first glass, you can only make sense of having another.

    Any lost productivity can be made up for elsewhere, but this dinner must end at some point.

  Persistent objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item I drink Yakult because I had \emph{something} in mind when I bought a months worth.
\item I still won't open some bottle of whisky because I'm saving it for some purpose.
\item You see a gift for a friend in a store but have to go to a meeting, and after you end up searching the store for the gift.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \dots and sometimes you might come across the gift again but are sure that you found something better.

    Snow dances and random flicker turns to rigid form as the agent regains focus.

    The supermarket aisle is empty, and their left hand is stretched toward an item as if ready to impart life.

    \emph{Crikey}!

    Forgetting the shopping list, and now forgetting consciousness.

    What were they doing?

    Their position suggests they were about to obtain the item.

    No basket. So, perhaps this is all they came in for.

    But what would the item be for?  What is the item a means to?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item An entailment is not required for the argument.
  \item Requiring an entailment would not help the argument.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item `Taking' would hold in all the cases in which `reasoning' does, but this would say nothing about the cases in which `reasoning' fails.
    \end{itemize}
  \item There may be good reason to `taking' and `reasoning' which would break the entailment.

  \frametitle{Types of cases (aside)}

  Professor Oblique is reasoning about an end, and considers a means (initially to some end) on the basis of a persistent object, but is unable to reason from the means to the end.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Three paramaters to vary:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Whether the agent is able to reason about the end.
    \item Whether the agent is able to reason about the means-end relation.
    \item Whether the agent is able to recall information about the end/means/means-end relation `internally' or `externally'
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Example questions:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Are there cases in which an agent recognises a means, but is unable to recall what the means is an end to, but would easily be able to reason from the end to the means were they able to recall the end?
    \item Could an agent rationally settle on a means if they have neither an end nor a candidate means-end relation?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
