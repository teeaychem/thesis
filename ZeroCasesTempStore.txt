  This is \AR, where the agent appeals to the attribute of having the ability to demonstrate the existence of a (particular) strategy.

  If so, the agent obtains support for the existence of the (particular) strategy from available reasons (reasoning).

  The intuitive idea is straightforward.

  Witnessing the relevant ability involves an event.
  Possessing the ability ensures that the relevant event may be witnessed by the agent.
  The propositions of interest are requirements on the relevant event.
  Therefore, it seems the agent doesn't need to appeal to witnessing.
  And, that the agent has the ability is accessible.

  Analogy, possible to hit a snooker ball into a pocket.
  There is a possible event, but there's a reduction to accessible stuff.
  If the agent didn't have the required resources, then even if it is possible, support seems a hard sell.
  At best, trivial due to lack of information.

  Ability is a little different.
  Witnessing provides the relevant demonstration, etc.

  In short, \AR gives a plausible sketch of how an agent may obtain support for the existence of the (particular) strategy, and satisfies the intuitive constraint that an agent may only appeal to reasons that they `have access' to.

    This reasoning doesn't say much about the nature of the support obtained for each of the premises.

    I assume that the agent is not able to rule out that the support the agent has may be misleading, and in particular that the agent may be mistaken about their ability to reason with the rules of chess.

    I also assume that the agent obtains sufficient support for being able to demonstrate the existence of a (particular) strategy.
    However, this does not require the agent to have the same degree of support for the ability to reason with the rules of chess (\ref{as:1}) or the conditional provided by the informer (\ref{as:2}) as the ability to demonstrate the existence of a (particular) strategy (\ref{as:4}).

    Likewise, the support the agent has for the existence of the (particular) strategy need be of equivalent strength to the support the agent has for the ability to demonstrate the existence of the strategy (\ref{as:4}).

    If the agent obtains support for the existence of the (particular) strategy by the reasoning sketched, the reasoning will be considered a success.

\begin{note}[Maybe something more]
  The argument given with transmission is somewhat tentative.
  Is there something more that may be said?

  Well, the idea is that going via general ability, the agent obtains support for required conditions for the verb.
  E.g.\ the existence of a strategy, the presence of a zebra in the pen, and so on.

  There is something of a puzzle, however.
  For, the general ability doesn't provide any information about the particular case.
  In the zebra case this is quite clear, and in the chess case some further reasoning is required, intuitively.
  Likewise, the conditional provided by the informer doesn't provide any information either.
  There is, then, quite some disconnect between the support and the relevant situation.

  Perhaps this isn't so strange.
  It is, more-or-less, standard with conditional information.
  Simple to come up with examples where the same things occurs and support seems fine.

  If you've been to the theme park then you get a free meal.

  No clear relation between the two.

  Feel as though support should fail because the agent doesn't appeal to the relevant witnessing.
  The relevant understanding is that you'll be able to do something so that you have support for the proposition.
  And, of course, the twist is that given this information, then it seems as though the agent has support that the required features of the event are in place.

  Yet, agent needs to do something for the event to occur.

  Okay, so if the agent comes to doubt that they have the general ability, then they're going to end up doubting that they have the specific ability.
  This much should seem clear.
  So, there's certainly some relation to the witnessing event.
  Right.
  But this, of course, isn't any kind of indication that the strategy doesn't exist.
  Or, need not be --- some instances may suggest that this is the case.

  So, the general ability has a significant role here.

  Is there some relation to the general ability.
  For, if the agent were to doubt that the requirements obtained, then the agent would be required to hold that they do not have the general ability.

  So, sure, but there's still something.
  Because generated support for general ability without resting on these requirements, it seems that support may extend to these requirements.
  This isn't immediate.
  Unclear whether these then follow or are potential defeaters.
  If potential defeaters, then appeal to reasoning is that there's event in which agent does the work to rule out the relevant defeaters, at least to some satisfactory degree.

  Defeaters are difficult, though.
  Still, if the agent obtains support, then it looks as though this might prevent failure to reason as a defeater.
  That's because with ability, there's no guarantee.
  Possible to try and fail, but still possess the ability.
  So long as the agent hasn't exhausted all of the options available to them.
  This traces the same idea, in the sense that the agent's support for the existence of a strategy seems surprisingly robust.
  Support is rooted in general ability and conditional information.
  Primarily general ability.

  No problem with the agent trying, but is a problem if the agent continues to hold support for specific ability.
  Premised to some degree on the relevant witnessing event.

  Right, background support is quite strong, and here there is no clear failure.
  If this is the case, then it should be possible to hold that one has the specific ability, but refrain from holding an attitude toward the fact.

\begin{note}[No detailed account]
In addition, no detailed account of why you hold claim \ref{inf:sse} is true follows from understanding the rules of chess and the game state alone.
For, one may understand the rules of chess and the game state while lacking the ability to demonstrate that claim~\ref{inf:sse} is true --- understanding the rules of chess and the game board is distinct from the ability to construct strategies.\nolinebreak
\footnote{
  Here I am relying on a principle \emph{like}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item An agent's grasp of \(\Sigma\) can provide an account of why they hold \(\phi\) is true only if the agent has the ability to demonstrate that \(\phi\) follows from \(\Sigma\).
  \end{itemize}
  {
    \color{red}
    Whether or not this claim is true depends in part of how ability is understood\dots
  }

  Perhaps it is the case that claim~\ref{inf:sse} is sufficiently obvious to guarantee that the agent has the ability.
  Still, the reasoning involved differs only in complexity from the reasoning involved in showing that White cannot prevent Black from checkmating in four moves, and I doubt that this claim is sufficiently obvious.

\begin{note}[Transmission failure, two parts]
  The argument is split into two parts.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{tf:arg:p:1} An argument that a fault occurs at some point in the reasoning.
  \item\label{tf:arg:p:2} Template for the specific fault.
  \end{enumerate}

  Part~\ref{tf:arg:p:2} deals with~\ref{tf:arg:p:1}.
  With a template for the specific fault, we may apply this to the argument to identify the relevant failure of transmission.
  Still, the template is motivated in part by identifying recognised failures of transmission.
  Hence, \ref{tf:arg:p:1} first.
  Argue that there is a failure, and identify where.
  This motivates the general template, and provides an argument that there is failure even if doubts are raised about the template.
