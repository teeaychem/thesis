\section{Scenarios}
\label{sec:scenarios}

\begin{quote}
  {\color{red} Here I can make references to desires as dispositional states to help motivate the worry.}
\end{quote}

\begin{scenario}\label{scn:gift}
  You've travelled up to London for a meeting, but with a little time to spare you decide to detour through Selfridges to see if you can find a gift for your friend.
  A little searching proves successful, but the item is on a high shelf and as realise that the item would be suitable your eyes focus on the clock on the far wall and you see that unless you leave now you'll be late.
  Still, the meeting won't last too long, so you make a mental note to return and buy the item.
  The meeting was strenuous, but when leaving you remember that Selfridges had a item you wanted to buy and you return.
  You walk up the stairs and through the aisles, but you can't recall what exactly it was which seemed so suitable as a gift.
  You think you've found the spot, but it doesn't seem quite right, and so you search some more.
  You remember that you saw a clock, and that helps narrow your search, but it's a big store and clocks can be seen from a variety of places.
  Perhaps, even, you're on the wrong floor.
\end{scenario}

There's something puzzling about this scenario.
You're searching for something, but you can't recall what it is.
If you could recall the item it would be straightforward to say that you desire to buy it, but that you cannot remember where it is, and as such your beliefs are failing you.
Still, here you cannot recall the item, and so if you do have a desire to buy the item it is a desire without representational content.
But if this is the case, it seems you have a desire that you can't explain, because it is a desire that you cannot represent.

For sure, when you first saw the item you desired to buy it, and one may argue that this desire is what leads you to search the store on your return.
However, you also desire to buy a gift for your friend and the particular item you saw was a means to this end.
Given the desire to buy a gift for your friend we can find fault in your beliefs.
You believed that the item was a suitable gift, and you formed an auxiliary desire for that item given this belief, but this desire had no independent motivational force, and you can explain that you returned to the store because of this desire to buy a gift and your belief that an item would satisfy that desire.

\begin{scenario}\label{scn:meal}
  It's early afternoon and it's already been a stressful day in the office.
  You find yourself day-dreaming in a meeting about a particularly satisfying meal you had, and while the meeting is adjourned you phone the restaurant to confirm that it's still on the menu and with this confirmed you book a table for you and your partner in the evening.
  At the end of the day you see that you have a table booked and you make your way over to the restaurant.
  After being seated you start to look at the menu, and while it's all very appetising you can't quite figure out why you're there.
  You ask your partner if they booked the table, but you did.
  You wonder why, but nothing comes to mind.
  It has been a stressful day, and that explains why you're eating out, but not why you're at this particular restaurant.
  You booked the table, but you booked the table for a reason, and there are handful of other restaurants you'd default to if you simply wanted to eat out.
  You realise that you probably wanted a particular item from the menu, but you can't recall which.
  Nor are you sure that you're desire to come wasn't premised on the atmosphere of the place.
  Still, you recognise that you desire to be here.
\end{scenario}


Scenario~\ref{scn:meal} shares many similarities to scenario~\ref{scn:gift}, but while in scenario~\ref{scn:gift} you could not recall a means to an end, in scenario~\ref{scn:meal} you cannot recall the end to which you have performed the means.
As such, this appears to be a puzzle about desire.
What explains why you are at the restaurant is your desire for a particular meal.
But your desire has no representational content.
Had you mentioned to your partner that you'd been thinking about the meal you shared last year they could have explained to you why you're there.
Or, if you'd taken down the name of the person you talked to on the telephone you could have asked them whether you made any requests.
Still, sitting as you are you can only say that there was a reason, and you think it was a particular meal.

Perhaps it's a mistake to think that you desire the particular meal you thought of while day-dreaming.
{\color{red} There are all sorts of reasons why this should fail.
  Basically going through the literature, looking at the main accounts.}
These concerns are compelling, but what puzzles me is that in both scenarios~\ref{scn:gift} and~\ref{scn:meal} it seems right to think that if you could recall what is was that you desire, you would be motivated to pursue that thing.
It seems more difficult to think that if you could recalled what is was that you \emph{desired}, you would be motivated to pursue that thing.
Perhaps this is because the latter formulation permits the possibility that your desires have changed, which should be ruled out.
The suggestion, however, is that to rule out the possibility that your desires have changed is to simply posit that the desires persist.
Of course, as the desire does not have representational content it cannot persist as an `ordinary' desire.
If it did you would buy the item or order the meal.
The suggestion developed more carefully is that the non-representational component of your desire persists.

\section{Intro}
\label{sec:intro}

Now, this can be seen as a lack of introspection.
But I'm really not sure what this affords us.
I think I'll say more about motivation later in the paper, and here's it's highlighting that it's a push.
It's not impossible, but it seems odd given the other resources available.


Getting the TV channel wrong and enjoying a film.
This is a case where the extrinsic desire is fine, but there's a problem.
You think you're satisfying a desire, but really you're finding out that something else satisfies the same desire.
Or, two YouTube links or whatever, one copied and you fail to copy the second.
Either way, you now have more information about what satisfies you.

So, that's the proposal.
Desire something because one reasons that it may satisfy them.

In these examples you're reasoning about what would satisfy you, in the same way that you may reason about what is true when you try to recall some fact that you've forgotten.
However, if this is the case then desires can't be `givens'.

The key is that in these scenarios one is trying to recreate the content.
One deosn't use the other desires one has.
There's cognitive significance without content.
Though, this term isn't quite right.

Incohate desires.

Then, washing machine example.
You lose some of the relevant propositional information.

Conversely, some other example where you refine the desire into something concrete.
Of course, here we can speak of desires being formed, but there's an appealing symmetry.
Indeed, in the relevant example it's simply going to be reading through the spec sheet, desiring something with a something or other spin.


So, what's going on?
Well, either you recover the content, or you start to construct a new desire, arguably.

But there's an assumption here that desires are fundamentally choate.
I suspect that this isn't the case.






\section{Attempt at a Thesis}
\label{sec:attempt-at-thesis}

Desires are propositional attitudes.
This much is fine.
But then they have representation content, at least on a na\"{i}ve view.
There is always the proposition, as so there is always something represented which is desired.
Appearances, judgements of the good, etc.\ etc.\
But I don't think this is right.
Representation content is one aspect of desire, and aspect which is certainly significant, but isn't the whole picture.
I think there's representation, cognitive significance, and participation.
The core idea is that of participation without representation.





\section{Propositional Attitudes}
\label{sec:prop-attit}


\begin{itemize}
\item Attribute beliefs and desires
\item Propositions
\item Indexicals
\item Belief/desire States
\item Information states
\item We attribute information states to agents, and our focus is on how agents project propositional content from this information state.
\item Belief is a report on this information state.
\end{itemize}

Information state is a set of worlds.
In this way, propositions are coerced into functions, or something.
The formalism is here to help exposition, and is not intended to carry any philsophical weight.

\[\phi(\sigma) = \top \text{ if } \forall w \in \sigma, w \vDash \phi\]
\[\phi(\sigma) = \bot \text{ if } \exists w \in \sigma, w \nvDash \phi\]

So, \(B\phi \text{ iff } \phi(\sigma) = \top\).
Or \(\sigma[\phi] = \sigma\), but this is different story.

It's also possible to allow for inconsistency by taking a composite information state of an agent \(\Sigma = \{\sigma_{1}, \dots\}\), and stating \(B\phi \text{ iff } \exists \sigma_{i} \in \Sigma, \phi(\sigma_{i}) = \top\).





Belief and desire as propositional attitudes, they relate an agent to a proposition.


\section{Some observations}
\label{sec:some-observations}

Desires really aren't important for what I have in mind.
One can take anything they want which would serve the function of desire, so reasons for action in a broad sense.
The question is about the status of these.
And, the basic idea is that there's a problem with taking these as basic, and further understanding success conditions.
Taking them as basic does, for sure, allow one to state the success conditions.
But, this is not the way we reason.
It's the success conditions themselves which keep us ticking.
It's trying to get a handle on this.
And, this leads into the weak and strong theses.
The weak is that the have access to success conditions at a certain point in our reasoning, and additional reasoning can lead us away from these.
The strong is that sometimes we don't even have access to the success conditions.

This comes out in the case of belief.
It's the fixing the stopwatch via the pendulum and via the church.

Reasoning, then, is structuring information around all of this.
What I come to form regarding pro-attitudes based on this kind of stuff doesn't amount to an intention, it's not necessarily in the slightest robust, and that's part of the point (and this is how the concerns link into the earlier paper).
However, it does suggest that desire-belief based reasoning has a lot to say for it.

This, at least, is the start.
Then there's some deep question about how this works out in the case of pracitcal reasoning, which is certainly something more involved.

\section{The Idea}
\label{sec:idea}

The basic idea is that there's what goes on in the mind of an agent.
Here, it's not just beliefs and desires.
It's something to do with the flow of information.
But there's information from two distinct sources.
One is the world, the other is the self, so to speak.
Trouble is, this information is noisy.
But this is only part of the problem, the other part is that this information is sometimes sparse.
There's a difference between sailing a small boat on a lake where one can see the shore, and sailing a boat on the ocean.
This is like walking down a path in comparison to walking through some woods.
Something like this, what's interesting about these cases, in some respect, is that they're to do one's location, but I don't think this is an important feature.


The core of the idea is that there's transition between information states, and that there doesn't need to be a causal connexion between the information state and the world.


\subsection{Weak thesis}
\label{sec:weak-thesis}

Assuming that one forms desires and beliefs in a way which ensures that appropriate states are proper, so to speak.
That one can have transitions between `desire states' which can diverge from the underlying (or perhaps better put motivating) desire.
This, arguably, parallels cases of belief.

One way to view this week thesis is the idea that one recognises a desire to \(\phi\), but \(\phi\)ing is something in the future, and as the time of \(\phi\)ing approaches, one loses track of \(\phi\) but knows (or believes) that one of \(\psi_{i}\) will entail \(\phi\).
The question, then, is which \(\psi_{i}\) to choose.
This is a problem, and a belief will step in, but it's not a straightforward case of a means-end belief as there's a problem in determining what the end is.

One example is buying a present.
Or, to go with meals, remembering you ordered something that you really enjoyed, but not being able to recall the name.

You are, then, acting on a desire but you have no idea what the propositional content of that desire is.

The alternative way for accounting for this kind of case is by supposing that there's a desire for each of the toys or menu items, and your reasoning attempts to adjudicate between these.
But I find it hard to really understand how this works here.

The idea is to contrast the third person and the first person cases.

There's also the case where someone forms a desire, and then the beliefs on which they form this desire no longer hold.
Ray had faculty with boots, I had adviser and quoting Shakespeare.
The puzzling thing about this is that the person is able to cite the certain determinate conditions, but none of these capture the desire.
Any condition stated doesn't work, unless they say that they want red boots.
Perhaps this is the way to go, but then an instrumental desire has turned into a self-standing desire.
Ah, in this sense I like Shakespeare case, as what's different is that the desire looks in some sense irrational.
Right, and with the Shakespeare they've started quoting Milton outside the office of the new chair.

\subsection{Strong thesis}
\label{sec:strong-thesis}


The weak thesis, but also denies that there's this requirement for appropriate states.
In the case of belief, this is forming the attitude independently of any evidence, so the parallel is thinking I have a fix on the pendulum by looking at the church.

The strong thesis, though, is not a \emph{very} strong thesis.
It still allows that there are these appropriate states, in that one does get hungry, or latches on to a particular normative reason.

The problem, then, is why these should be allowed.
It's possible to posit further reasons, reasons `in the background' so to speak.
Be this as it may, this blocks the kind of reasoning that I've been describing.
So, what does this explain?
Well, it's a mix between the sort of learning theory that Dretske goes for and a more robust type of reasoning which Goldman endorses.

Potentially motivating cases here involve enhancements.


\subsection{Objection}
\label{sec:objection}

The key objection, at least to my understanding, is that it seems possible to have some instance of reasoning which is \emph{about} or \emph{concerns} satisfaction without this having some motivational component.
This, then, pushes the inclusion of some desire proper, which stands behind the reasoning, and explains its motivational force.

So, there's some quality of the mental which makes certain states motivationally effective.
And, while the above distinction does some work, it doesn't capture this distinction.

The analogy I then want is with cases in which certain recognised beliefs aren't motivationally effective.
That is, an argument that there's something missing in our talk of belief.
So, in a sense, beliefs which don't enter into the causal nexus of things, but are likewise indistinguishable from other beliefs.
Examples involving phobias seem to be a good candidate for this.
One has a very specific motivational desire.
But, despite believing that this thing isn't an instance of what they have a phobia toward, they still act as though it was.
It's quite plausible, I want to argue, that the belief isn't correctly hooked up to the causal mechanisms.
And, it doesn't make sense to explain this via some other desire.
Say, they've done this before.
Actually, right, the agent is there and avows all of the `right things'.
Further, could enrich so that these types of cases have happened before, and that eventually the belief does make it's way.




\section{Timepieces}
\label{sec:timepieces}

There's something about clocks.

Clocks are about time, they represent time, and clocks participate in time.
Still, while the tick of a second hand relies on the passage of time, time in which causal forces drive the internal mechanism of the clock to move the hand from resting in one position to another, the passing second does not itself cause the hand to move.
Clocks are about time, but they do not interact with it.

Clocks are about time, but they do not interact with it.
Of course, hours, minutes, and seconds are somewhat arbitrary, and it may be claimed that there is---properly speaking---no second to have caused the hand to move.
Be this as it may, seconds pass and we individuate on second from another by the minute in which it occured, and the hour in which that minute occured.
Or, perhaps we count the seconds which have passed and individuate minutes and hours based on this count.
03:14:07 on Tuesday the 19th of January 2038 may be a large number, but there are an infinity of those.
Either way, even if there's no such thing as seconds to cause the ticking of clocks, seconds exists as measurements of time and by indexing some point in time and measuring some number of seconds (\dots minutes, or hours) we can travel from different parts of the Cotswolds to meet at The Exchange.

The trasition between states of the clock are not caused by the passage of time, as noted by~\textcite{Smith:1988aa}.

\section{Sailing and Hunger}
\label{sec:sailing-hunger}

There's some nice parallels here.
Navigation at sea and hunger.
Both cases there are observations and rational transitions between these.
I mean, with the hunger it's not necessary, and so perhaps there's still a better case to consider.
What I need is a transition between mental states with marked observations to calibrate these.
Reading a book, perhaps.
One doesn't consider their enjoyment at every stage, but from time to time.
Running a race is like this too, and most sort of sport-like activities can be understood in these terms.
Ah, the trouble is, unlike hunger, these sorts of things can be explained by other pro-attitudes.
Well, running is different, as there are cases where one doesn't really have a goal in mind, and is just going for a run, and you don't check whether you `want' to continue, instead you do this somewhat randomly.



\section{Folk-theory}
\label{sec:folk-theory}

Folk-theory isn't all that profound, it's simply the assumption that people aren't all that complex at a fundamental level.
Without good reason we should not treat the complex web of attitudes that we have as anything more than variations of a theme.
Beliefs and desires enter the picture only in so far as there are distinct directions of fit, so to speak.
And, in this respect both beliefs and desires are placeholders.
A number of things may fill these places, and a number of things might occupy both places simultaneously.

In this respect, the Humean thinks that there are two places.
Standard anti-Humeans allow for the possibility that there's a single place.
I, on the other hand, think that am not so interested in the places, but with reasoning.


\section{Tests}
\label{sec:tests}

Typically we think of propositions as sets of worlds.
E.g.\ \(\phi = \{w_{i}, \dots, w_{k}, \dots\}\) where the it is the commonalities between \(w_{i}, \dots, w_{k}, \dots\) which determine the meaning of \(\phi\).
This, however, isn't the full story, as we can likewise think of propositions as \emph{tests}, functions from (sets of worlds) to truth values.
From a certain perspective, this is what's captured by the use of the lambda calculus.
One can take \(\lambda w.\phi(w) = \top\), etc.\

But, this isn't quite the full story.
