\section{Scenarios}

  {\color{red} Here I can make references to desires as dispositional states to help motivate the worry.

\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  Suppose I have a piece of paper according to which, inter alia, Collingwood is east of Fitzroy.
  Can I tear the paper up so that I get one snippet that has exactly the content that Collingwood is east of Fitzroy, nothing more and nothing less?
  If the paper is covered with writing, maybe I can; for maybe 'Collingwood is east of Fitzroy' is one of the sentences written there.
  But if the paper is a map, any snippet according to which Collingwood is east of Fitzroy will be a snippet according to which more is true besides.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }(\citeyear[310]{Lewis:1999ab})
\end{quote}

\begin{scenario}\label{scn:gift}
  You've travelled up to London for a meeting, but with a little time to spare you decide to detour through Selfridges to see if you can find a gift for your friend.
  A little searching proves successful, but the item is on a high shelf and as realise that the item would be suitable your eyes focus on the clock on the far wall and you see that unless you leave now you'll be late.
  Still, the meeting won't last too long, so you make a mental note to return and buy the item.
  The meeting was strenuous, but when leaving you remember that Selfridges had a item you wanted to buy and you return.
  You walk up the stairs and through the aisles, but you can't recall what exactly it was which seemed so suitable as a gift.
  You think you've found the spot, but it doesn't seem quite right, and so you search some more.
  You remember that you saw a clock, and that helps narrow your search, but it's a big store and clocks can be seen from a variety of places.
  Perhaps, even, you're on the wrong floor.
\end{scenario}

There's something puzzling about this scenario.
You're searching for something, but you can't recall what it is.
If you could recall the item it would be straightforward to say that you desire to buy it, but that you cannot remember where it is, and as such your beliefs are failing you.
Still, here you cannot recall the item, and so if you do have a desire to buy the item it is a desire without representational content.
But if this is the case, it seems you have a desire that you can't explain, because it is a desire that you cannot represent.

For sure, when you first saw the item you desired to buy it, and one may argue that this desire is what leads you to search the store on your return.
However, you also desire to buy a gift for your friend and the particular item you saw was a means to this end.
Given the desire to buy a gift for your friend we can find fault in your beliefs.
You believed that the item was a suitable gift, and you formed an auxiliary desire for that item given this belief, but this desire had no independent motivational force, and you can explain that you returned to the store because of this desire to buy a gift and your belief that an item would satisfy that desire.

% \begin{scenario}\label{scn:meal}
%   It's early afternoon and it's already been a stressful day in the office.
%   You find yourself day-dreaming in a meeting about a meal you had last year, and while the meeting is adjourned you phone the restaurant to confirm that it's still on the menu and with this confirmed you book a table for you and your partner in the evening.
%   At the end of the day you see that you have a table booked and you make your way over to the restaurant.
%   After being seated you start to look at the menu, and while it's all very appetising you can't recall why you're there.
%   You ask your partner if they booked the table, but you did.
%   You remember calling the restaurant to ask about a meal, and you recall your desire for a particular meal.
%   You look through the menu, but after multiple passes you can't recall the exact meal you had been day-dreaming about.
%   % It has been a stressful day, and that explains why you're eating out, but not why you're at this particular restaurant.
%   % You booked the table, but you booked the table for a reason, and there are handful of other restaurants you'd default to if you simply wanted to eat out.
%   % You realise that you probably wanted a particular item from the menu, but you can't recall which.
%   % Nor are you sure that you're desire to come wasn't premised on the atmosphere of the place.
%   % Still, you recognise that you desire to be here.
% \end{scenario}

\begin{scenario}\label{scn:song}
  It's early afternoon and you're talking with a colleague in a coffee shop.
  A song comes on the radio.
  The coffee shop is busy and you're trying to focus on the current topic of conversation, but you'd like to listen to the song properly.
  You briefly ask your colleague if they know what song is playing and they tell write down the title and the artist on a napkin for you.
  At the end of the day you walk to a record store while humming to see if you can purchase a copy of the song, but the store is closed.
  So, you set yourself a reminder to return at the weekend while running errands.

  As you enter the store you remember the napkin and take it from your pocket, but as you pull out the napkin you realise the ink has run and you only have the name of the artist.
  You recall that you asked your colleague to write down a song, but you can't bring to mind anything other than thanking your colleague as you put the napkin in your pocket.
  Still, the store offers you a booth so you can search through the artists discography for the song you're looking for.
  And, as you think that upon hearing the song again you'll recognise it and remember why you asked for its information you sit down and being to listen.
\end{scenario}

Scenario~\ref{scn:song} shares many similarities to scenario~\ref{scn:gift}, but while in scenario~\ref{scn:gift} you could not recall a means to an end, in scenario~\ref{scn:song} you cannot recall the end to which you have performed the means.
As such, this appears to be a puzzle about desire.
What explains why you are searching through a discography is your desire to listen to a particular song.
However, your desire lacks representational content; you can't recall anything about the song itself, nor why your colleague wrote it on a napkin.
So, sitting in the booth you have both a desire and a means to satisfy it, but you can't explain what the means are for.
Perhaps you wanted to listen to the song, but maybe you wanted to give a copy to a friend, or it may have been a recommendation from your colleague.

All that can be said is that you desire to do something with the song that was meant to be written on the napkin.
In other words, you desire to satisfy the end to which you are taking means.

For sure, you are disposed to take actions that will likely bring about listening to the song again, but you do not believe that you are taking these actions in order to bring about listening to the song.
Nor is your attention is directed toward the song prior to hearing it and thoughts of the song do not occur to you in a favourable light, though on hearing the song again it would appear `good' or pleasurable.
The difficulty is that you will be satisfied when hearing the song in the booth.
Equally, you would be satisfied if you heard the song on the radio when at home, or if a friend played it to you.

These considerations suggest that your desire persists, even though you cannot attribute content to it.
It seems right to think that if you could recall what is was that you desire you would be motivated to pursue that thing, perhaps by a more direct application of the means you're already engaged, or perhaps by some other means.
It seems more difficult to think that if you could recalled what is was that you \emph{desired}, you would be motivated to pursue that thing.
Perhaps this is because the latter formulation permits the possibility that your desires have changed, which should be ruled out.
The suggestion, however, is that to rule out the possibility that your desires have changed is to simply posit that the desires persist.
Of course, as the desire does not have representational content it cannot persist as an `ordinary' desire.
If it did you would be exploring rather than searching through the discography.

Of course, it is possible that you no longer have the desire to hear the song again.
You may tire of searching through the discography, or you may hear some other song which draws your attention.
It may be that you only have the desire to recognise the song that you desired to hear again, perhaps you mistake the song for another, or when played again you're sure you heard something else.
So, you desire to hear the song again may morph into a different desire, and in this respect perhaps your desire morphed into something else when the thought of the song slipped from your mind.
However, on the assumption that you are satisfied on hearing the song again it is hard to see why we should be committed to change in desire.
For sure, there is a change in your relation to what you desire, but what you desire does not change.\nolinebreak
\footnote{\color{red} Note connexions to Rip van Winkle in \textcite{Perry:1997aa}.}

\paragraph{ }
To put cards on the table, I adhere to the received wisdom about desire, which \citeauthor{McDaniel:2008aa} characterise by the following three theses:\nolinebreak
\footnote{\color{red} Also happy to endorse conditional desire, but it's not that relevant here.}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(RW\arabic*)]
\item Desire is a relation between a person and a proposition.
\item \emph{S}'s desire that \(P\) is satisfied iff \(P\) is true.
\item \emph{S}'s desire that \(P\) is frustrated iff \(P\) is not true.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[269]{McDaniel:2008aa})
\end{enumerate}
Desire is a propositional attitude which consist of a person (at a time) desiring that some proposition is true.
This tells us \emph{what} is desired (that a proposition be true) but not \emph{how} it is desired.
And, it is the \emph{how} not the \emph{what} of your desire that is at issue in scenario~\ref{scn:song}.
I follow \citeauthor{Kaplan:1989ab} and \citeauthor{Perry:1993aa} in distinguishing the cognitive significance of the proposition an agent has an attitude toward from the proposition thereby related.\nolinebreak
\footnote{\color{red} Pointing out that a bunch of authors highlight that these puzzles arise for desire as well as belief (and other attitudes) and that this is pretty much an exploration of what's going on in such cases, with a focus on dynamics.}

There are a number of ways `how' can be understood.
Following \citeauthor{Kaplan:1989ab} we may talk of the \emph{character} of a desire, say the desire to alight at the last northbound stop of the Caltrain, which may relate you to the proposition that you alight at 4th \& King or the proposition that you alight at 22nd St., depending on whether a full service is running and with other contextual factors similarly fixed.
Still, while character affords us representational content which can relate the same desire to different propositions depending on content, it requires some content in order to specify which proposition an agent is related to given a context and the problem we have is that your desire to listen to the song again has no representational content.
So, following \citeauthor{Perry:1997aa} we may talk of the \emph{causal role} of desires; the various combinations of factors that bring the desire about and the various combinations of factors that the desire brings about in turn. (\citeyear[360--361]{Perry:1997aa})
Causal roles generalise characters they require only a functional specification of the relevant state, and as such need not be characterised by some utterance or thought.

Of course, at a base level we are (part of) causal networks and so talk of the causal role of desires can be seen to occupy an uneasy middle ground between folk-psychology and full blown psychology in which the conception of desire as a relation between an agent and a proposition may serve no theoretical role.
So, \citeauthor{Perry:1997aa}'s talk of causal roles should be understood, following \textcite{Lewis:1979aa}, with respect to how we (as folk) systematise the minds of ourselves and others.
Taking desires to be a relation between an agents and a propositions and investigating how these relations are secured facilitate systematic common-sense psychology; an account of how you and I reason about ourselves and others.
(\citeyear[{\color{red} ???}]{Lewis:1999ab})
It is analytic that we employ folk-theory when reasoning about ourselves and others and that this systematises causal relations, but it doesn't follow from this that causal relations have a substantive role in our systematisation.
For this reason I wish to eschew talk of the causal role of desires and will instead talk of how desires \emph{participate} in the practical reasoning of agents.
Desires participate an agent's practical reasoning by being brought about by various combinations of factors both internal and external to the agent and by bringing about various combinations of factors both internal and external to the agent.
Nothing changes from \citeauthor{Perry:1997aa}'s characterisation of causal roles, but we have unburdened ourselves from some unease and have allowed ourselves some distance from \citeauthor{Perry:1997aa}'s understanding of propositional attitudes, should we need it.\nolinebreak
\footnote{\color{red} As noted above (or maybe just here) the authors all suggest that while the focus is on belief, same issues hold for desire.}
We also now have a slogan for our puzzle: participation without representation.
Still, participation without representation is not a puzzle for folk-theory.
The scenario given above follows ordinary reasoning and so its coherence with folk-theory is secure, instead the puzzle concerns our high-level philosophical characterisations of folk-theory.

It may be argued that participation without representation is insufficiently commonplace to require attention in our high-level characterisations of folk-theory.
We doubt that participation without representation is so rare.
Scenario~\ref{scn:song} is contrived to make the phenomenon clear, and more standard cases can be found.
Further examples include driving to a supermarket to fetch an important ingredient only to traverse the aisles, beginning a sentence only to pad while trying to recall the motivating thought, or hurrying to finish a task only to pace the room while trying recall what you planned to do at leisure.
For sure, the quick presentation of these examples does not require us to posit the participation of a desire which you cannot grasp, as for this we must assume that when you find the ingredient, finish the thought, or engage in the leisure activity that you satisfy your prior desire.
It is possible that you return empty-handed, let the sentence unravel, or decide to engage in some other activity, but often your desire is satisfied.
And, while these examples rely on the same means-end schema used to generate scenario~\ref{scn:song}, the broad idea may find use in exploring instances of the phenomenon noted by \citeauthor{Anscombe:1957aa} in which the question `Why?' has application as an appropriate question by has no answer (\citeyear[\SS17--18]{Anscombe:1957aa}).
The point is that by considering participation without representation we enrich our characterisation of folk-theory, and we hope to show that this enrichment is instructive.

For sure, participation without representation is a particular instance of the way in which participation and representation come apart.
Generalising \citeauthor{Kaplan:1989aa}'s notion of character grants us representation with varying participation and participation with varying representation.
Likewise, representation without participation may be explored.
We focus on the former due to the prevalence of appeal to representation in the characterisation of desires, pro-attitudes, and practical reasoning, and as the lessons of \citeauthor{Kaplan:1989aa}, \citeauthor{Lewis:1979aa}, and \citeauthor{Perry:1993aa} with respect to the latter cases straightforwardly generalise from beliefs to desires.


{\color{red}
  Here I want to say something about having a desire to figure out what you desired.
  This can happen, but it doesn't need to, and the way I've set the case up is quite unreflective.
  But even if it does, this doesn't really explain anything, you have no way of representing that desire, and that's the problem.
  It's also that this doesn't get the satisfaction conditions correct.
  Either you then are satisfied when you find out, and you reform the desire or it was there all along.

\section{Schroeder's Taxonomy}
\label{sec:schroeders-taxonomy}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Standard Theory 1 (ST1)}:
  To desire that \(P\) is to be disposed to bring it about that \(P\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[11]{Schroeder:2004aa})
\end{quote}

So, good for following \citeauthor{Ryle:1949aa} where dispositional ascriptions license inferences as these don't need to attribute representations.

\begin{quote}
  To desire that \(P\) is to be disposed to act in ways that would tend to bring it about that \(P\) in a world in which one's beliefs, whatever they are, were true.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[15]{Stalnaker:1984aa})
\end{quote}
{\color{red} correlative dispositional states of a potentially rational agent, the tendency-to-bring-about relation. But, (\citeyear[18]{Stalnaker:1984aa}) for \citeauthor{Stalnaker:1984aa} discussing the role of content. [22--23] also reinforces this.
    \begin{quote}
      It is essential to rational activities such as deliberation and investigation that the participants represent alternative possibilities, and it is essential to the role of beliefs and desires in the explanation of action that the contents of those attitudes distinguish between the alternative possibilities.\nolinebreak
      \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[23]{Stalnaker:1984aa})
    \end{quote}
  }
  
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{ST2}:
  To desire that \(P\) is to be so disposed that, if one were to believe that taking action \(A\) would be an effective method for bringing it about that \(P\), then one would take \(A\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[17]{Schroeder:2004aa})
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{ST3}:
  To desire that \(P\) is to have a structure inside one whose biological function is to bring it about that \(P\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[18]{Schroeder:2004aa})
\end{quote}

{\color{red}
  I don't really see any reason to go through with this account.
}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{ST4}:
  To desire that \(P\) is to have a mental representation that \(P\) which plays a certain causal role, namely, that of disposing one to bring it about that \(P\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[24]{Schroeder:2004aa})
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  A person has a desire in the directed-attention sense that \(P\) if the thought of \(P\) keeps occurring to him or her in a favorable light, that is to say, if the person’s attention is directed insistently toward considerations that present themselves as counting in favor of \(P\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }(\citeyear[39]{Scanlon:1998aa})
\end{quote}

However, here \citeauthor{Scanlon:1998aa} takes this account of desire to correspond to the intuitive sense, and as such this doesn't correspond to the place-holder pro-attitude view.

\citeauthor{Scanlon:1998aa} does offer a sort of account of attitudes around (\citeyear[20]{Scanlon:1998aa}), but this is heavily idealised, and it's not clear to me what to get from this.
But, I guess the problem is that now fixed it's not judgement sensitive.


\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Hedonic Theory 1 (HT1)}:
  To desire that \(P\) is to be so disposed that one will tend to feel pleasure if it seems that \(P\), and/or displeasure if it seems that not-\(P\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[27]{Schroeder:2004aa})
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{HT2}:
  To desire that \(P\) is to contain some structure (this being the desire) which so disposes one that one will tend to feel pleasure if it seems that \(P\), and/or displeasure if it seems that not-\(P\).\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[27]{Schroeder:2004aa})
\end{quote}


\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Reward Theory of Desire (RTD)}:
  To have an intrinsic (positive) desire that \(P\) is to use the capacity to perceptually or cognitively represent that \(P\) to constitute \(P\) as a reward.
  To be averse to it being the case that \(P\) is to use the capacity to perceptually or cognitively represent that \(P\) to constitute \(P\) as a punishment.\nolinebreak
  \mbox{ }\hfill(\citeyear[131]{Schroeder:2004aa})
\end{quote}

{\color{red}
  Okay, I need to get clear on exactly what's going on here.
  I've got a distinction between \emph{how} and \emph{what} and this is good.
  However, it now comes to stating what's going on with motivation.
  The desire cannot be the reason why you act, in the sense that it's not the thing you take to be going on in your practical reasoning.
  Yet, if there wasn't that desire you're reasoning wouldn't happen in the way it does.
  So, there's a difference between the how and the what, and here there's really not even a `how' in the standard sense of the term.
  So, the desire only has an indirect role in your practical reasoning.
  It gives you the means that you currently take to be relevant in determining what to do, and it also gives the conditions under which you'll be satisfied.
  However, clearly it cannot be part of your deliberation.
  So, this is the puzzle stated.
  The part I need to emphasise is that when you hear the song again you're able to discharge the means, but this might require some work on motivating some of the practical reasoning.
}

{\color{blue}
  The puzzle, then, is that given this analysis, there are desires which have a role in practical reasoning which is indirect.
  So, we won't get a good analysis of desire if we focus on the things you reason about.
  In other words, an analysis of reasons for action will not provide an analysis of practical reasoning.
  That is, there's no complete story of practical reasoning which pieces together reasons for action with some decision procedure.
  So, can't take desires as `givens'.
  Instead, need to reason about (expected) satisfaction.
  That's what's going on in the scenario.
  You're reasoning that there's something which you expect to satisfy you to which you have the means.
}

{\color{green}
  Oh, and in cases of akrasia you're reasoning about something which you expect to satisfy you but for which you don't have the means.
  This, is really nice.
  (Though also rather sad.)
}

{\color{blue}
  Well, then, given the above relations to propositions are still the core of desire, and the idea is that having access to representational content is what allows agents to actually do things.
  Well, it allows us to do thing in the way we do them.
  The motivational component comes first, and we use practical reasoning to guide this.
  (This is really what deals with the problem of akrasia, and the proposal only makes sense in this context.)
  And, the way the argument is going is that there's a way in which we can understand motivation without resorting to a given proposition.
  For better or worse we can't really reason without some representation content, and the interesting thing about us is that we are able to do this.

% What explains why you are searching through the menu at the restaurant is your desire for a particular meal.
% But your desire has no representational content.
% Had you mentioned to your partner that you'd been thinking about the particular meal they could have explained to you why you're there.
% Or, if you'd taken down the name of the person you talked to on the telephone you could have asked them about your request.
% Still, sitting as you are you can only that you desire a particular meal, but that you don't know which.


{\color{red} Problem is that the counterfactual isn't obviously true.
  For example, taking the dispositional states, there's no clear proposition that the agent stands in a relation to, but this shows that the desire has simply been corrupted.
  Then, it reduces to a problem of introspection.}

{\color{blue} Well, the general idea is that it seems as though this is a problem with introspection, and when we grant that introspection can fail, there's no problem with specifying various desires.
  So, it's the case that the puzzling desires really aren't the same desires without representational content, but that they're different desires.
  In short, the continuity is somewhat misplaced.}



\section{Intro}
\label{sec:intro}

Now, this can be seen as a lack of introspection.
But I'm really not sure what this affords us.
I think I'll say more about motivation later in the paper, and here's it's highlighting that it's a push.
It's not impossible, but it seems odd given the other resources available.


Getting the TV channel wrong and enjoying a film.
This is a case where the extrinsic desire is fine, but there's a problem.
You think you're satisfying a desire, but really you're finding out that something else satisfies the same desire.
Or, two YouTube links or whatever, one copied and you fail to copy the second.
Either way, you now have more information about what satisfies you.

So, that's the proposal.
Desire something because one reasons that it may satisfy them.

In these examples you're reasoning about what would satisfy you, in the same way that you may reason about what is true when you try to recall some fact that you've forgotten.
However, if this is the case then desires can't be `givens'.

The key is that in these scenarios one is trying to recreate the content.
One deosn't use the other desires one has.
There's cognitive significance without content.
Though, this term isn't quite right.

Incohate desires.

Then, washing machine example.
You lose some of the relevant propositional information.

Conversely, some other example where you refine the desire into something concrete.
Of course, here we can speak of desires being formed, but there's an appealing symmetry.
Indeed, in the relevant example it's simply going to be reading through the spec sheet, desiring something with a something or other spin.


So, what's going on?
Well, either you recover the content, or you start to construct a new desire, arguably.

But there's an assumption here that desires are fundamentally choate.
I suspect that this isn't the case.






\section{Attempt at a Thesis}
\label{sec:attempt-at-thesis}

Desires are propositional attitudes.
This much is fine.
But then they have representation content, at least on a na\"{i}ve view.
There is always the proposition, as so there is always something represented which is desired.
Appearances, judgements of the good, etc.\ etc.\
But I don't think this is right.
Representation content is one aspect of desire, and aspect which is certainly significant, but isn't the whole picture.
I think there's representation, cognitive significance, and participation.
The core idea is that of participation without representation.



\section{Propositional Attitudes}
\label{sec:prop-attit}


\begin{itemize}
\item Attribute beliefs and desires
\item Propositions
\item Indexicals
\item Belief/desire States
\item Information states
\item We attribute information states to agents, and our focus is on how agents project propositional content from this information state.
\item Belief is a report on this information state.
\end{itemize}

Information state is a set of worlds.
In this way, propositions are coerced into functions, or something.
The formalism is here to help exposition, and is not intended to carry any philsophical weight.

\[\phi(\sigma) = \top \text{ if } \forall w \in \sigma, w \vDash \phi\]
\[\phi(\sigma) = \bot \text{ if } \exists w \in \sigma, w \nvDash \phi\]

So, \(B\phi \text{ iff } \phi(\sigma) = \top\).
Or \(\sigma[\phi] = \sigma\), but this is different story.

It's also possible to allow for inconsistency by taking a composite information state of an agent \(\Sigma = \{\sigma_{1}, \dots\}\), and stating \(B\phi \text{ iff } \exists \sigma_{i} \in \Sigma, \phi(\sigma_{i}) = \top\).





Belief and desire as propositional attitudes, they relate an agent to a proposition.


\section{Some observations}
\label{sec:some-observations}

Desires really aren't important for what I have in mind.
One can take anything they want which would serve the function of desire, so reasons for action in a broad sense.
The question is about the status of these.
And, the basic idea is that there's a problem with taking these as basic, and further understanding success conditions.
Taking them as basic does, for sure, allow one to state the success conditions.
But, this is not the way we reason.
It's the success conditions themselves which keep us ticking.
It's trying to get a handle on this.
And, this leads into the weak and strong theses.
The weak is that the have access to success conditions at a certain point in our reasoning, and additional reasoning can lead us away from these.
The strong is that sometimes we don't even have access to the success conditions.

This comes out in the case of belief.
It's the fixing the stopwatch via the pendulum and via the church.

Reasoning, then, is structuring information around all of this.
What I come to form regarding pro-attitudes based on this kind of stuff doesn't amount to an intention, it's not necessarily in the slightest robust, and that's part of the point (and this is how the concerns link into the earlier paper).
However, it does suggest that desire-belief based reasoning has a lot to say for it.

This, at least, is the start.
Then there's some deep question about how this works out in the case of pracitcal reasoning, which is certainly something more involved.

\section{The Idea}
\label{sec:idea}

The basic idea is that there's what goes on in the mind of an agent.
Here, it's not just beliefs and desires.
It's something to do with the flow of information.
But there's information from two distinct sources.
One is the world, the other is the self, so to speak.
Trouble is, this information is noisy.
But this is only part of the problem, the other part is that this information is sometimes sparse.
There's a difference between sailing a small boat on a lake where one can see the shore, and sailing a boat on the ocean.
This is like walking down a path in comparison to walking through some woods.
Something like this, what's interesting about these cases, in some respect, is that they're to do one's location, but I don't think this is an important feature.


The core of the idea is that there's transition between information states, and that there doesn't need to be a causal connexion between the information state and the world.


\subsection{Weak thesis}
\label{sec:weak-thesis}

Assuming that one forms desires and beliefs in a way which ensures that appropriate states are proper, so to speak.
That one can have transitions between `desire states' which can diverge from the underlying (or perhaps better put motivating) desire.
This, arguably, parallels cases of belief.

One way to view this week thesis is the idea that one recognises a desire to \(\phi\), but \(\phi\)ing is something in the future, and as the time of \(\phi\)ing approaches, one loses track of \(\phi\) but knows (or believes) that one of \(\psi_{i}\) will entail \(\phi\).
The question, then, is which \(\psi_{i}\) to choose.
This is a problem, and a belief will step in, but it's not a straightforward case of a means-end belief as there's a problem in determining what the end is.

One example is buying a present.
Or, to go with meals, remembering you ordered something that you really enjoyed, but not being able to recall the name.

You are, then, acting on a desire but you have no idea what the propositional content of that desire is.

The alternative way for accounting for this kind of case is by supposing that there's a desire for each of the toys or menu items, and your reasoning attempts to adjudicate between these.
But I find it hard to really understand how this works here.

The idea is to contrast the third person and the first person cases.

There's also the case where someone forms a desire, and then the beliefs on which they form this desire no longer hold.
Ray had faculty with boots, I had adviser and quoting Shakespeare.
The puzzling thing about this is that the person is able to cite the certain determinate conditions, but none of these capture the desire.
Any condition stated doesn't work, unless they say that they want red boots.
Perhaps this is the way to go, but then an instrumental desire has turned into a self-standing desire.
Ah, in this sense I like Shakespeare case, as what's different is that the desire looks in some sense irrational.
Right, and with the Shakespeare they've started quoting Milton outside the office of the new chair.

\subsection{Strong thesis}
\label{sec:strong-thesis}


The weak thesis, but also denies that there's this requirement for appropriate states.
In the case of belief, this is forming the attitude independently of any evidence, so the parallel is thinking I have a fix on the pendulum by looking at the church.

The strong thesis, though, is not a \emph{very} strong thesis.
It still allows that there are these appropriate states, in that one does get hungry, or latches on to a particular normative reason.

The problem, then, is why these should be allowed.
It's possible to posit further reasons, reasons `in the background' so to speak.
Be this as it may, this blocks the kind of reasoning that I've been describing.
So, what does this explain?
Well, it's a mix between the sort of learning theory that Dretske goes for and a more robust type of reasoning which Goldman endorses.

Potentially motivating cases here involve enhancements.


\subsection{Objection}
\label{sec:objection}

The key objection, at least to my understanding, is that it seems possible to have some instance of reasoning which is \emph{about} or \emph{concerns} satisfaction without this having some motivational component.
This, then, pushes the inclusion of some desire proper, which stands behind the reasoning, and explains its motivational force.

So, there's some quality of the mental which makes certain states motivationally effective.
And, while the above distinction does some work, it doesn't capture this distinction.

The analogy I then want is with cases in which certain recognised beliefs aren't motivationally effective.
That is, an argument that there's something missing in our talk of belief.
So, in a sense, beliefs which don't enter into the causal nexus of things, but are likewise indistinguishable from other beliefs.
Examples involving phobias seem to be a good candidate for this.
One has a very specific motivational desire.
But, despite believing that this thing isn't an instance of what they have a phobia toward, they still act as though it was.
It's quite plausible, I want to argue, that the belief isn't correctly hooked up to the causal mechanisms.
And, it doesn't make sense to explain this via some other desire.
Say, they've done this before.
Actually, right, the agent is there and avows all of the `right things'.
Further, could enrich so that these types of cases have happened before, and that eventually the belief does make it's way.




\section{Timepieces}
\label{sec:timepieces}

There's something about clocks.

Clocks are about time, they represent time, and clocks participate in time.
Still, while the tick of a second hand relies on the passage of time, time in which causal forces drive the internal mechanism of the clock to move the hand from resting in one position to another, the passing second does not itself cause the hand to move.
Clocks are about time, but they do not interact with it.

Clocks are about time, but they do not interact with it.
Of course, hours, minutes, and seconds are somewhat arbitrary, and it may be claimed that there is---properly speaking---no second to have caused the hand to move.
Be this as it may, seconds pass and we individuate on second from another by the minute in which it occured, and the hour in which that minute occured.
Or, perhaps we count the seconds which have passed and individuate minutes and hours based on this count.
03:14:07 on Tuesday the 19th of January 2038 may be a large number, but there are an infinity of those.
Either way, even if there's no such thing as seconds to cause the ticking of clocks, seconds exists as measurements of time and by indexing some point in time and measuring some number of seconds (\dots minutes, or hours) we can travel from different parts of the Cotswolds to meet at The Exchange.

The trasition between states of the clock are not caused by the passage of time, as noted by~\textcite{Smith:1988aa}.

\section{Sailing and Hunger}
\label{sec:sailing-hunger}

There's some nice parallels here.
Navigation at sea and hunger.
Both cases there are observations and rational transitions between these.
I mean, with the hunger it's not necessary, and so perhaps there's still a better case to consider.
What I need is a transition between mental states with marked observations to calibrate these.
Reading a book, perhaps.
One doesn't consider their enjoyment at every stage, but from time to time.
Running a race is like this too, and most sort of sport-like activities can be understood in these terms.
Ah, the trouble is, unlike hunger, these sorts of things can be explained by other pro-attitudes.
Well, running is different, as there are cases where one doesn't really have a goal in mind, and is just going for a run, and you don't check whether you `want' to continue, instead you do this somewhat randomly.



\section{Folk-theory}
\label{sec:folk-theory}

Folk-theory isn't all that profound, it's simply the assumption that people aren't all that complex at a fundamental level.
Without good reason we should not treat the complex web of attitudes that we have as anything more than variations of a theme.
Beliefs and desires enter the picture only in so far as there are distinct directions of fit, so to speak.
And, in this respect both beliefs and desires are placeholders.
A number of things may fill these places, and a number of things might occupy both places simultaneously.

In this respect, the Humean thinks that there are two places.
Standard anti-Humeans allow for the possibility that there's a single place.
I, on the other hand, think that am not so interested in the places, but with reasoning.


\section{Tests}
\label{sec:tests}

Typically we think of propositions as sets of worlds.
E.g.\ \(\phi = \{w_{i}, \dots, w_{k}, \dots\}\) where the it is the commonalities between \(w_{i}, \dots, w_{k}, \dots\) which determine the meaning of \(\phi\).
This, however, isn't the full story, as we can likewise think of propositions as \emph{tests}, functions from (sets of worlds) to truth values.
From a certain perspective, this is what's captured by the use of the lambda calculus.
One can take \(\lambda w.\phi(w) = \top\), etc.\

But, this isn't quite the full story.
