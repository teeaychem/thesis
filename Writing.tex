\title{Second Year Paper: Practical Reasoning}
\author{Benjamin Sparkes}
% \date{ }

\begin{document}

In \citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s presentation of the Two Glasses of Wine scenario your reversal of evaluative ranking is hedged; `you \emph{seem} to value the second glass of wine more highly than refraining from that second glass' (\citeyear[emphasis added][257]{Bratman:2007ab}).
\citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab} goes on to argue that your temptation cannot be a simple inclination (\citeyear[cf.][258]{Bratman:2007ab}) and proposes a distinguished class evaluative rankings which have \emph{agential authority} such that under certain circumstances a ranking fail to constitute where an agent stands.
An evaluative ranking can the fail to command action, not in virtue of being a simple inclination, but in virtue of failing to have relevance in an agent's practical reasoning.

Broadly put, the straightforward characterisation of your evaluative rankings needs to be hedged as it does not distinguish between those which do and don't carry authority, and while your evaluative rankings are reversed in certain cases of temptation, this reversal need not be motivationally effective.
In this respect, your evaluative rankings are given and fixed, but where you stand in relation to these rankings is up to you.

I agree with \citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab} that your temptation is not mere inclination, but I disagree that your evaluative rankings should be taken as given and fixed.
Instead, I hold that your evaluative rankings are a result of your practical reasoning, and in cases of temptation your evaluative rankings change as a result of deliberation.
When you seem to value the second glass of wine more than refraining you really do value the glass more than refraining, and if your reasoning were to conclude at that moment you would drink the second glass.
However, you may engage in further reasoning, and this reasoning may lead to changes in your evaluative rankings.

It as clear that the evaluative rankings of agent's do change.
In \citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s scenario you move from having an evaluative ranking in favour of a single glass to a ranking in favour of two.
Intuitively, this can be traced to a change in context.
You moved from a context in which you had not drunk a glass of wine, to a context in which you had.
Generally speaking, the relevant change in context and why it has an effect of your evaluative rankings may vary.
For example, you may rank one pair of shoes over another until you have the opportunity to try them on, and after gathering information about how they fit you, your ranking of the pairs may change.
In this case you receive new information which bears on your ranking, and your ranking changes in light of this information.
Still, in \citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s scenario it does not appear that you gain new information.
You may come to know what it's like to have a glass of wine, but it is a reasonable assumption that you have drunk a glass of wine before, and so the change in context cannot be attributed to a change in information.
Instead, the relevant change in context appears to be how you reason with the information available to you, under the influence of the first glass of wine, you value a second glass more than refraining.

Supposing that a change in evaluative rankings is always due to a change in context, the ability for agent's to resist temptation in cases such as \citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s scenario remains puzzling as after the first glass of wine there doesn't appear to be any further change in context.
We may suppose that your from the decision to resist before the effect of the first glass on your reasoning wears off, and likewise that nothing in your immediate environment changes.
If this is correct, as I will assume, then your resistance to temptation cannot (always) be straightforwardly explained by a change in context.
However, an agent's reasoning should not be taken as a function of the context in which they are in.
We noted that a change in reasoning may be attributed to a change in context, but agent's are also able to reason about the contexts they are in.
In this respect, after the first glass of wine you may reason about how you are reasoning given you have drunk a single glass of wine.
Put this way such reasoning may sound complex, but we routinely engage in such reasoning.
For example, we refrain from driving when we are tired as we recognise that the relevant decision making will be impaired, and we keep our distance from an opponent at the end of a game of tennis for fear of what our anger may lead us to do.
And, in line with these examples we may refrain from drinking a second glass of wine on recognition that our reasoning is unduly influenced by the first.

\citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s proposal can be seen as an explanation of why we side with our alert, calmer, or sober, selves.
An alternative proposal is that we recognise that our evaluative rankings are the result of reasoning, and the reasoning of our alert, calmer, or sober, selves is better equipped to track what is of value to us, and so we may defer evaluative rankings to prior (or counterfactual) reasoning.
In cases of temptation, then, you may recognise that you are in a certain context, and change your reasoning on recognition of this.
Your evaluative rankings, then, may change due to how much confidence you have that your present reasoning is able to track what is of value to you.


% \citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s solution then involves showing how there is complex value.




% \citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab} holds that folk psychology is an extensive, but tacit, shared understanding of how we work mentally which holds that `a system of beliefs and desires tends to cause behaviour that serves the subject's desires according to [their] beliefs'. (\citeyear[320]{Lewis:1999ab})
% In this respect folk psychology is a power instrument of prediction and explanation, and we can tell which predictions and explanations conform to its principles, even if we cannot systematically present those principles.
% Mental states are characterised by their causal role in a system, and the particular content that these mental states have when the system is applied to an agent explains and predicts the particular behaviour of the agent.

% \citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab} advances two important arguments about folk psychology.
% First, given that folk psychology identifies mental states by their causal role, folk psychology does not carry information about what (if anything) instantiates the mental.
% Second, even though folk psychology does not carry information about what instantiates causal roles (and hence is agnostic about how content works), it still places constraints on what the content of mental states can be, defined by the typical causal role of that content.

% The primary upshot of the above understanding of folk psychology is that we have a shared understanding of how we work mentally which doesn't carry substantive metaphysically commitments about what the mental is, but is secured by its explanatory and predictive power.
% This, in turn, allows us to construct a simple theory of the mental via conceptual analysis which can aid a metaphysical account of what there is.\nolinebreak
% \footnote{\citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab}'s broader argument in \citetitle{Lewis:1999ab} is that mental states are contingently identical to physical states, hence the focus on the relationship between folk psychology and metaphysics.}

% \citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab}'s argument that folk psychology does not carry information about what (if anything) instantiates the mental is a consequence of identifying mental states with causal roles in a certain kind of system.
% For something to occupy a certain role is for that thing to function as part of a system, and so long as that system does not make reference to how it is instantiated, it will not carry information about what occupies any of the roles it specifies.
% That folk psychology does not carry information to how it is instantiated can be seen as assumed by \citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab}'s characterisation of folk psychology as a \emph{theory}, if one takes theories to (roughly) be symbolic systems with rules for manipulation which seems implied by \citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab}, with a fixed interpretation with which the meaning of the symbolic expressions can be reconstructed (\citeyear[cf.][298]{Lewis:1999ab} and \citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab}'s discussion of Ramsification).
% However, \citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab} also provides a direct argument by arguing that our folk-psychological conceptions of mental states cannot discriminate between what actually instantiates the causal role and some other unactualized alternative.
% If folk psychology carried information about what instantiated causal roles we would be able to discriminate between distinct instantiations of the same role, but intuitively we cannot.
% For example, consider whether pain could be instantiated in multiple ways; intuitively we reference only a certain experience which typically leads to certain patterns of behaviour and do not make reference to anything more.
% Hence, as folk psychology concerns shared understanding, this intuition is evidence that folk psychology does not carry information about what (if anything) instantiates the mental.
% (\citeyear[304]{Lewis:1999ab})

% \citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab}'s argument that folk psychology places constraints on what the content of mental states can be denies that the content of mental states is given only by wide content; content which depends upon which external things you are suitably connected to be relations of acquaintance (\citeyear[312]{Lewis:1999ab}).
% \citeauthor{Lewis:1999ab} argues that wide content gives a suitable account of what is believed, but not \emph{how} it is believed.
% Narrow content, but contrast, is determined by the typical causal roles of mental states and gives information about how your behaviour is caused.
% It is independent of what one is acquainted with.
% For example, you and I may share the narrow content given by 'I want to go home', even though I (the agent) am neither acquainted with you nor your home, given that we both exhibit similar behaviour with respect to the contexts in which we act.
% So, given that folk psychology posits a shared system of mental states which cause behaviour, and our best sense of what causes our behaviour appears to be accounted for by shared beliefs and desires which are acquainted with different external things, folk psychology posits the same (narrow) content to our mental states.

% In summary, as folk psychology specifies both the function role of mental states and the content of mental states without reference to what instantiates these roles and their content, and so folk theory does not carry substantive metaphysical implications.

\paragraph{Writing Task}\mbox{ }

\citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s Two Glasses of Wine scenario highlights a problem which arises from the combination of desire for general patterns of behaviour where on any given occasion the satisfaction of one desire leads to the frustration of the other deisre.
Below we present a simplified version of \citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s scenario.
In the background we assume a principle which links desire to action by stating that if you have a desire and are able to perform an action to satisfy that desire, you will perform that action.

\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{w:gP} You have a desire for a general pattern of behaviour in which you have a pleasant dinner.
\item\label{w:gW} You have a desire for a general pattern of behaviour in which you engage in productive after dinner work.
\item\label{w:glass} If you have a glass of wine with your dinner, you will satisfy your desire for a pleasant dinner.
\item\label{w:condBad} If you have a second glass of wine, you will frustrate your desire to engage in productive after dinner work.
\item\label{w:oneGlass} Given~\ref{w:gP} and~\ref{w:glass}, on any given occasion you desire to have a glass of wine with each dinner.
\item\label{w:good} By~\ref{w:gW} and~\ref{w:condBad}, on any given occasion you desire not to have a second glass of wine with dinner.
\item\label{w:glassCond} On any given occasion, if you have a glass of wine with your dinner, you will desire a second glass of wine.
% \item\label{w:bad} By~\ref{w:condBad}, if you have a second glass of wine you will frustrate your desire to engage in productive after dinner work.
\item\label{w:rTwo} On any given occasion, if you have a glass of wine with your dinner, then by \ref{w:glassCond} and the background assumption you will have a second glass of wine with your dinner.
\item\label{w:conflct} By~\ref{w:oneGlass} and~\ref{w:rTwo}, on any given occasion if you satisfy your desire to have a pleasant dinner you will frustrate your desire not to have a second glass of wine with dinner (\ref{w:good}).
\item\label{w:notGood} Given that \ref{w:conflct} holds for any given occasion, you cannot satisfy your general desires given in~\ref{w:gP} and~\ref{w:gW}
\end{enumerate}

Steps \ref{w:glass} and \ref{w:condBad} link your behaviour on a given occasion to the satisfaction and frustration of your desires for general patterns of behavrious (premises \ref{w:gP} and~\ref{w:gW}, respectively).
Steps~\ref{w:oneGlass} and~\ref{w:good} relate your general desires to desires regarding particular occasions.
Premise \ref{w:glassCond} is the crucial premise to generating the problem, it is a premise about your desire on particular occasions, and does not directly conflict with your desires for general patterns of behaviour.
Step \ref{w:rTwo} uses step \ref{w:oneGlass} and the background assumption to state your behaviour on any given occasion given the assumption that you satisfy your desire for a glass of wine.
Step \ref{w:conflct} observes that your desires regarding particular occasions cannot be jointly satisfied, and step \ref{w:notGood} generalises this failure of satisfaction to a problem for your general pattern of behaviour.
The problem, then, is that two distinct desires for general patterns of behaviour may be conflict free when considered independently of individual instances of behaviour, but conflict on every instance.


\newpage
\paragraph{Original scenario}

\begin{scenario}[Wine]\label{sc:wine}
  Suppose you value both pleasant dinners and productive work after dinner.
  One pleasant aspect of dinner is a glass of wine.
  Indeed, two glasses would make the dinner even more pleasant.
  The problem is that a second glass of wine undermines your efforts to work after dinner.
  So you have an evaluative ranking concerning normal dinners: dinner with one glass of wine over dinner with two glasses.
  So far so good. The problem is that when you are in the middle of dinner, having had the first glass of wine, you frequently find yourself tempted.
  As you see it, your temptation is not merely a temporary, felt motivational pull in the direction of a second glass: if it were merely that we could simply say that, in at least one important sense, practical reason is on the side of your evaluative ranking.
  Your temptation, however, is more than that; or so, at least, it seems to you.
  Your temptation seems to involve a kind of evaluation, albeit an evaluation that is, you know, temporary.
  For a short period of time you seem to value the second glass of wine more highly than refraining from that second glass.
  It is not that you have temporarily come to value, quite generally, dinner with two glasses of wine over dinner with one glass.
  You still value an overall pattern of one glass over an overall pattern of two glasses; after all, productive after-dinner work remains of great importance to you.
  But in the middle of dinner, faced with the vivid and immediate prospect of a second glass this one time, you value two glasses over one glass just this one time.\nolinebreak

\citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab} proposes a conjecture to explain how agents can resist cases of temptation in which their evaluative ranking of present options at the time of action conflict with their general policies regarding their known evaluative ranking of options before and after the time of action.
This conjecture draws on two distinct aspects of temporally extended practical reasoning.

On the one had, the pragmatic role of policies regarding evaluative rankings in an agent's practical reasoning to enable complex, cross-temporal, and coordinating roles in order for an agent to satisfy their most important ends.
And, on the other hand, the role of certain evaluative judgements as having authority in allowing an agent to identify the structure of their practical reasoning as their own.

\citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s conjecture is that in cases of temptation an on-balance judgement of practical rationality requires a convergence in these two aspects of an agent's practical reasoning, so that the agent sees their general policies of regarding evaluative rankings as their own, such that the conflicting evaluative ranking for the present option does not have a stronger claim to authority in reflecting what the agent values.

\citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab} makes a number of assumptions regarding practical reasoning.
\begin{itemize}
\item Practical reasoning involves weighing various pros and cons concerning alternative options.
\item Valuing something involves a policy of treating that thing as a justifying consideration in one's practical reasoning.
\item An \emph{on-balance} judgement states what is rational for you to do relative to all your relevant ends, valuings, and the like.
\item If an agent is able to reach an on-balance judgement, they will act in accordance with that judgement, so long as they act rationally.
\end{itemize}

Given these, it follows that in order for an agent to resist temptation, they must form an on-balance judgement they must form an on-balance judgement favouring resilience.
So, the two aspects of support \citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab} offers for his requirement (the pragmatic role of policies and agential authority) can be seen as insufficient but non-redundant parts of an unnecessary but sufficient condition for an on-balance judgement (which may be necessary in cases of temptation).

\citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s argument for the pragmatic role of policies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item On-balance judgements are typically anchored in an agent's evaluative rankings of present options at the time of action.
\item Policies to act are, likewise, typically grounded in an agent's evaluative rankings.
\item\label{p:pol-role} Policies have complex, cross-temporal, and coordinating roles.
\item\label{p:bk-down} A break down in the roles described in \ref{p:pol-role} typically frustrate an agent's most important ends.
\item By \ref{p:bk-down}, an agent will not typically give evaluative weight to considerations (or value options) which conflict with their policies.
\end{enumerate}

The pragmatic role of policies, then, can help ensure that an agent does not succumb to reasoning about tempting options.
However, in cases of temptation an agent does give evaluative weight to considerations (or value options) which conflict with their policies and so this pragmatic role alone cannot explain how agents resist temptation.

\citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s argument for the role of agential authority:

\begin{enumerate}
\item On-balance judgements of rationality belong to a framework of practical reasoning which is, in a strong sense, the agent's own framework.
\item An agent's present evaluative rankings have priority for on-balance judgements of rationality as they have the authority to articulate, in the face of conflict, the agent's relevant perspective on their present options.
\end{enumerate}

Agential authority likewise can help ensure that an agent does not succumb to reasoning about tempting options so long as the agent does not see their evaluative judgements as representing their own perspective.
However, in cases of temptation the agents evaluative rankings for the tempting option does have a claim to authority as they are the present evaluative rankings of the agent.

Still, in cases of temptation an agent's policies also have claim to authority.
Further, this is a distinctive claim to authority as the policy is grounded in cross-temporal judgements, while the tempting option is a singular judgement.
Therefore, the policy may have a greater claim to authority and provide the basis for an on-balance judgement, hence \citeauthor{Bratman:2007ab}'s conjecture.
