\chapter{\qWhyV{} and \qHowV{}}
\label{cha:var}


\begin{note}
  \autoref{cha:intro}, introduced \qWhy{} and \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{}.
  The primary role of the present chapter is to state a sufficient condition for answer to \qWhy{}.

  However, we will also state a necessary condition for certain answers to \qHow{}.

  In order for counterexample to \issueInclusion{}, sufficient condition satisfied, necessary condition unsatisfied.

  To reduce cognitive overhead, we provide variant questions to \qWhy{} and \qHow{} and observe a constraint on the variant question to \qWhy{} in terms of the variant question to \qHow{} follows from the conditions and \issueInclusion{}.

\label{cha:var:qwhyvnp}



\subsection{A sufficient condition}
\label{sec:sufficient-condition}

\begin{note}
  \begin{condition}[\ros{3} and progressive explanation]%
    \label{obs:qWhyEIP}%
    Given \(e_{d}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\):

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      There is some \se{} \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) of \(e_{d}\) such that conditions \ref{obs:qWhyEIP:prog} and \ref{obs:qWhyEIP:ros} hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
      \item
        \label{obs:qWhyEIP:prog}
        \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) is such that \(e_{d}\) is in progress.
      \item
        \label{obs:qWhyEIP:ros}
        \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) is such that \(e_{d}\) is in progress \emph{only if} a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) holds throughout \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then:}]
      The \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-2\baselineskip}
  \end{condition}

  \begin{motivation}{obs:qWhyEIP}
    \autoref{obs:qWhyEIP} is an instance of \autoref{obs:PE}, adapted to an event in which an agent concludes, and where the relevant feature \(f\) is that a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) holds throughout \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\).

  Hence, Condition~\ref{obs:qWhyEIP:ros} ensures a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is sufficiently entwined in \(d^{\flat}\) so that it is not possible to characterise \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) as an event in which concluding without the a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) holding from the \agpe{}.
\end{motivation}

  \noindent%
  In a slogan, `progressive explanation'.
  Taking a step back, understand `why' an event happened by looking at what was in progress during events the relevant event was a result of.
\end{note}

\paragraph{An illustration}
% \label{sec:an-illustration}

\begin{note}
  \begin{scenario}[Countersign]
    \label{scen:countS}
    \indent The captain mumbled, ``I come from Miran.''

    The man returned the gambit, grimly.
    ``Miran is early this year.''

    The captain said, ``No earlier than last year.''

    But the man did not step aside.
    He said, ``Who are you?''

    ``Aren't you Fox?''

    ``Do you always answer by asking?''

    The captain took an imperceptibly longer breath, and then said calmly,
    ``I am Han Pritcher, Captain of the Fleet, and member of the Democratic Underground Party.
    Will you let me in?''%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[70]{Asimov:1945aa})}%
    \newline
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  In the event described by \autoref{scen:countS} Fox concludes \propI{The person Fox is talking to is a fellow member of the Democratic Underground Party} is \valI{True}.
  Pritcher calmly tells Fox the are a fellow member of the party at the end of the \scen{}.
  Still, Fox has already drawn the conclusion when Fox asks `Who are you?' via the sequence of countersigning.
  And, intuitively, Pritcher saying, No earlier than last year' in response to Fox saying `Miran is early this year' explains why the event develop in an event in which Fox concludes Pritcher is a fellow member of the party.

  Consider the \se{0} \(e^{\flat}\) from Pritcher's response to `Miran is early this year' with `No earlier than last year' and Fox asking `Who are you?'.
  The following conditional holds, from \agpe{Fox's}:
  %
  \begin{itenum}
  \item[\emph{If}:]
    They didn't appropriately respond to `Miran is early this year'.
  \item[\emph{Then}:]
    They're not engaging in countersign.
  \end{itenum}
  %
  And, if Fox doesn't think Pritcher is engaging in countersign, it seems clear Fox does not conclude Pritcher a fellow member of the party.
  Hence, phrased in terms of \ros{}, we have:
  \begin{itenum}
  \item[\emph{If}:]
    A \ros{} between \pv{\propI{What they said was an appropriate response}}{\valI{True}} and some \pool{} \(\Psi\) fails to hold from \agpe{Fox's} through \(e^{\flat}\).
  \item[\emph{Then}:]
    \(e^{\flat}\) is not, or does not develop into an event in which Fox concludes \propI{The person Fox is talking to is a fellow member of the Democratic Underground Party} is \valI{True} from some \pool{} \(\Phi\).
  \end{itenum}
  In this respect, \ros{} answers \qWhy{}.
\end{note}



\subsection{The variant question}
\label{cha:var:qwhyvnp:question}

% \footnote{
%     \nocite{Tichy:1976tp}%
%     The \itc{} of \qWhyV{} captures the presence of a lawlike constraint, as it applies regardless of whether or not the agent goes on to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

%     In the literature on subjunctive conditionals, the conditionals which constrain the development of events are sometimes termed `laws' (\cite{Chisholm:1955aa,Lewis:1979vm,Veltman:2005tj}) or thing that `lump together' certain facts (\cite{Kratzer:1981aa,Kratzer:1989aa}).
%   }

\begin{note}
  \qWhyV{} directly queries \ros{} which satisfy the sufficient condition for answers to \qWhy{}:

  \begin{question}{questionWhyV}{\qWhyV{}}%
    Given \(e_{d}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\):

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Which \ros{1} are such that:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        For some \se{0} \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) of \(e\) such that \(e_{d}\) is in progress:
        \begin{itenum}
        \item[\emph{If}:]
          A \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) fails to hold from \agpe{\vAgent{}'} through \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\).
        \item[\emph{Then}:]
          \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) is not an event such that \(e_{d}\) is in progress.
        \end{itenum}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-1.5\baselineskip}
  \end{question}

  \noindent%
  And, a link between \qWhy{} and \qWhyV{} follows in parallel from \autoref{obs:qWhyEIP}:

  \begin{link}[\qWhyV{} and \qWhy{}]%
    \label{link:why:support:pvpp}%
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      A \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is an answer to \qWhyV{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      The \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is an answer to \qWhy{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{link}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  To close this section we make a brief observation:

  \begin{observation}%
    \label{obs:qWhyV:rosNNecAns}%
    A \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) may answer \qWhyV{} though the \ros{} is unrelated to why \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) follows from \(\Phi\) from the \agpe{\agents{}}.
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{obs:qWhyV:rosNNecAns}
    Consider a \scen{0} in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) where partway through the agent concludes to brew a cup of tea.

    It may well be the case that the agent fails to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) without the aid of the tea.
    For, without a warm cup of reassurance, the agent gives up.
    and, if so, a \ros{} between \pv{\propI{Brew a cup of tea}}{\valI{Do}} and some \pool{} \(\Psi\) answers \qWhyV{}.

    Still, from the \agpe{\agents{}}, the cup of tea was only a nice thing to have.
  \end{motivation}

  \noindent%
  Intuitively it is not be the case that the \ros{} and the conclusion to get some tea answers why \emph{the agent} concluded some theorem is true from some \pool{}.%
    \footnote{
      \citeauthor{Armstrong:1968vh} (\citeyear[195--196]{Armstrong:1968vh}) discusses a similar example, and suggests further discussion of this issue may also be found in \textcite{Moore:1962up}.
      See also \citeauthor{Sanford:1989aa} (\citeyear{Sanford:1989aa}) for a discussion of dependence as captured by subjunctive conditions (esp.\ pp.\ 192--193).
    }

    Still, \qWhy{} and \qWhyV{} concern the way in which an event in which an agent concludes develops, and various \ros{} which hold during an event when an agent concludes may answer this.

    Note, however, it must be the case that a \ros{} is required to hold in order for a \se{} to be a event in which the agent is concluding.
    Hence, a \ros{} between \pv{\propI{Brew a cup of coffee}}{\valI{Do}} and some \pool{} \(\Psi'\) does not answer \qWhyV{} as the agent concluded to get tea, rather than coffee (and even if the choice between tea and coffee was a figurative coin flip).
    And, a \ros{} between \pv{\propI{Brew a cup of tea}}{\valI{Do}} and \(\Psi\) fails to answer \qWhyV{} if the agent may have concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) without the aid of the cup of tea.
\end{note}



\section{\qHowV{}}
\label{cha:var:qhowv}


\begin{note}
  In parallel to the sufficient condition for answers to \qWhy{}, we observe a necessary condition for certain answers to \qHow{}, and the necessary condition allows us to state a variant of \qHow{} without reference to `how'.
  In perpendicular to sufficient condition for answers to \qWhy{}, the necessary condition for certain answers to \qHow{} is more-or-less immediate.
  The role of the condition and variant question is to help formulate a nice variant of \issueInclusion{}.
\end{note}


\subsection{Necessary condition}
\label{sec:necessary-condition}

\begin{note}
  The necessary condition for certain answers to \qHow{} is as follows:

  \begin{condition}[\wit{3}]%
    \label{cond:nH}%
    For any event \(e'\):
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      Both \ref{cond:nH:aH} and \ref{cond:nH:cPVP} are true:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=\arabic*]
      \item
        \label{cond:nH:aH}
        \(e'\) answers \qHow{}.
      \item
        \label{cond:nH:cPVP}
        \(e'\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(e'\) is a \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{condition}

  \noindent%
  \autoref{cond:nH} follows directly from the definition of a \wit{}.
  Indeed, the consequent follows from Condition~\ref{cond:nH:cPVP} and the definition of a \wit{} alone.
  Still, \autoref{cond:nH} is relevant to our interests, as \issueInclusion{} only constrains answers to \qWhy{} in terms of answers to \qHow{} when both conditions~\ref{cond:nH:aH} and~\ref{cond:nH:cPVP} are satisfied.
\end{note}

\subsection{The question}
\label{cha:var:qhowv:question}

\begin{note}
  The variant of \qHow{} is as follows:

  \begin{question}{questionHowV}{\qHowV{}}%
    \label{q:how:v}%
    Given \(e\) is an event which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Which events \(e^{\sharp}\) are such that both \ref{q:how:v:bos} and \ref{q:how:v:wit} hold:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        \label{q:how:v:bos}
        \(e^{\sharp}\) happens before or at the same time as \(e\).
      \item
        \label{q:how:v:wit}
        \(e^{\sharp}\) is a \wit{0} for some \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{question}

  \noindent%
  In short, \qHowV{} asks which \ros{1} an agent has a \wit{} for when the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \linkH{} immediately follows from \autoref{cond:nH} and the statement of \qHowV{}:

  \begin{link}[\qHowV{} and \qHow{}]%
    \label{link:how-witnessing}%
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      Both \ref{link:how-witnessing:a:1} and \ref{link:how-witnessing:a:2} are true:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{link:how-witnessing:a:1}
        \(e\) answers \qHow{}.
      \item
        \label{link:how-witnessing:a:2}
        \(e\) is an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(e\) answers \qHowV{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{link}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}[A guaranteed answer to \qHowV{}]%
    \label{prop:phi-always-how}%
    Any prior or present event \(e\) in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is an answer to \qHowV{}.
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:phi-always-how}
    Immediate by \autoref{def:witnessing}.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\section{\issueConstraint{}}
\label{cha:var:issue}

\begin{note}
  A constraint between \qWhyV{} and \qHowV{} follows from \linkW{}, \linkH{}, and \issueInclusion{}:

  \begin{proposition}[\qWhyV{}-\qWhy{}-\qHow{}-\qHowV{}]%
    \label{prop:support-and-witnessing}%
      \linkW{}, \linkH{}, and \issueInclusion{} (jointly) entail the following conditional:
      \begin{itenum}
      \item[\emph{If}:]
        A \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is an answer to \qWhyV{}.
      \item[\emph{Then}:]
        An event \(e\) which \wit[es]{0} a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qHowV{}.
      \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:support-and-witnessing}
    Suppose \qWhyV{} is answered, in part, by a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
    Then:

    By~\linkW{} the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{}.

    Hence, by \issueInclusion{}, an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) answers \qHow{}.

    And finally, by \linkH{}, the event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) answers \qHowV{}.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}[Sanity check]
    \label{prop:vSantity}
    A \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is always an answer to \qWhyV{}.
    And an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is always an answer to \qHowV{}.
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:vSantity}
    \color{green}
    Suppose \(e_{d}\) is an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    We need to show there is some \se{0} \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) of \(e\) such that:
    %
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      A \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) fails to hold from \agpe{\vAgent{}'} through \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) is not an event such that \(e_{d}\) is in progress.
    \end{itenum}
    %
    Consider \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) as the event in which the agent pairs \(\phi\) with \(v\).

    \(e^{\flat}_{d^{\flat}}\) is clearly a \se{} of \(e_{d}\).
    For, by \autoref{def:conclusionE} an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\)
    {
      \color{green}
      Happens as a result of the \evalN{}.
    }

    By \supportI{}, a \ros{} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for the agent, when .
    Further, \dots

    as a \se{0} of an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    So it is immediate that if a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) fails to hold when the agent concludes, the agent does not conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \medskip

    Now for \qHowV{}.

  \end{argument}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} constrains answers to \qWhyV{} in terms of answers to \qHowV{} and passes the basic sanity check.
  Hence, we reformulate \autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} as a constraint that parallels \issueInclusion{}:

  \begin{constraint}{consConstraint}{\issueConstraint{}}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      A \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhyV{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \vAgent{} has a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) when \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{constraint}

  \noindent%
  The remainder of the document focuses on (counterexamples) to \issueConstraint{}.
  For, if there are counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}, then it immediately follows by \autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} that either \linkW{}, \linkH{}, or \issueInclusion{} fails to hold.

  So, if you like, you may now forget about \qWhy{} and \qHow{} and \issueInclusion{}.
\end{note}



\section*{Summary}

\begin{note}
  Overall argument.
  Links then answer to \qWhyV{} which is not constrained by \qHowV{}, then \issueInclusion{} fails.

  Three broad ways in which the overall argument may fail:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
  \item
    The link between \qWhyV{} and \qWhy{} fails to hold.
  \item
    The link between \qHowV{} and \qHow{} fails to hold.
  \item
    We fail to develop counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.
  \end{enumerate}

  Still, I hope to have developed \qWhyV{}, \qHowV{}, and \issueConstraint{} in such a way that both questions are of some interest independent of link.
\end{note}


% \section{The role of variant questions}
% \label{cha:var:sec:wiggling}

% \begin{note}
%   \autoref{cha:introduction} introduced \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{}.


%   The overall goal of this document is to argue \issueInclusion{} does not hold.

%   Hence, without establishing a clear understanding of the way in which the instances are to be understood, it is unclear how to develop counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   In broad outline, we use the idea of a `\ros{0}' to provide variations on \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{}.
%   The way in which we understand \ros{1} is minimal and tightly connected to an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
%   Specifically, we put forward three ideas in relation to \ros{1}:
%   \begin{enumerate}
%   \item
%     If an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), then a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for the agent, when the agent pairs \(\phi\) with \(v\).
%   \item
%     If an agent has concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), then the event in which the agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) functions as a \wit{0} for a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
%   \item
%     It is possible for a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) to hold, from an \agpe{}, without their being an \wit{0} for the \ros{0}.
%   \end{enumerate}

%   \autoref{cha:var:ros} will develop and discuss each idea in detail.

%   For the moment, the motivation for abstracting to \ros{1} is to capture, in a abstract way, the way in which \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) are related from an \agpe{} when the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

%   Rather than directly capturing some relevant sense of `why' or `how' our goal is to use \ros{1} to construct variations on \qWhy{} and \qHow{} which are \emph{roughly} `extensionally adequate'.
%   Where, we understand the term `extensionally adequate' more-or-less in line with \citeauthor{Sumner:1987aa} (\citeyear{Sumner:1987aa}):

%   \begin{quote}
%     [A] conception of a concept is extensionally adequate when it includes every item which seems pre-analytically to be an instance of the concept and excludes every item which does not.%
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[49]{Sumner:1987aa})}
%   \end{quote}

%   Adapted to our case, our interest with \qWhy{} and \qHow{} is with respect to intuitive answers to \qWhy{} and \qHow{} (and in particular the intuition that \issueInclusion{} holds).
%   And, the variations of both \qWhy{} and \qHow{} may be seen as `conceptions of a question' such that any answer to \qWhy{} is an answer to the variation of \qWhy{}, vice-versa, and the same with respect to \qHow{}.

%   Still, the way in which something answers \qWhy{} need not be equivalent to the way in which that thing answers the variation to \qWhy{}.%
%   \footnote{
%     In this respect, the variation to \qWhy{} need not be \emph{intensionally} adequate.
%     Where the variation of \qWhy{} (or \qHow{}) would be intensionally adequate just in case the variation captured the way something \emph{intuitively} answers \qWhy{}.
%   }

%   And, we are only interested in `rough' extensional adequacy.
%   In particular, we are only interested in answers to \qWhy{} and \qHow{} to the extent that \issueInclusion{} plausibly holds.
%   Hence, we will ignore intuitive answers to \qWhy{} and \qHow{} which extend beyond \issueInclusion{}.

%   Further, to the extent that \issueInclusion{} is intuitive, the variations \emph{may} conflict with this intuition.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   With the aid of \ros{1} we develop variations of \qWhy{} and \qHow{}:

%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     Interpret `why' from \qWhy{} in terms of the \ros{1} the \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) depended on.
%   \item
%     Interpret `how' from \qHow{} in terms of events which \wit{0} any \ros{} that the \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) depended on.
%   \end{itemize}

%   % So, the variation to \qWhy{} is expected to be extensionally adequate for:

%   An significant consequence of both variations will be as follows:

%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     When an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\):
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%       The \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) depends on a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) holding, for the agent.
%     \item
%       The event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) serves as a \wit{0} for the \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
%     \end{itemize}
%   \end{itemize}
%   Hence, a \ros{} between \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) will always be, in part, an answer to the variation of \qWhy{} and the event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) will always be, in part, an answer to the variation of \qHow{}.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   A variant to \issueInclusion{} follows from the variations to \qWhy{} and \qHow{}.
%   Roughly:

%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     A conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) depends on some \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) holding for the agent

%     \emph{Only if}:

%     The agent has a \wit{} for the \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   With an initial understanding of the variations to \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{} in hand, we now return to the overall argument of this document.
%   Our goal is to develop counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
%   And, given the variation to \issueInclusion{} which follows from the variations to \qWhy{} and \qHow{}, we will do so by showing there are cases in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) such that:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     The agent pairing \(\phi\) and \(v\) depended on a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) holding, for the agent.
%   \item
%     The agent did not have a \wit{0} for the \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) when the agent paired \(\phi\) and \(v\).
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
  % As with \qWhyV{} our interest is with extensional adequacy, and specifically extensional adequacy with respect to \ros{1}.

  % Consider any event.
  % There are two cases.
  % \ros{} which answers \qWhyV{} or no \ros{}.

  % If no \ros{} then the \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) does not depend on what happened.
  % Hence, event is not of direct interest with respect to answering `how' an agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  % If \ros{} which \qWhyV{}, then included as an answer to \qHowV{}.

  % So, though we have abstracted to \ros{1} to avoid any account of what conclusion amounts to, the existence of a \wit{0} intuitively captures whatever it is of relevance that happened when the agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  % And, as discussed in \autoref{cha:var:ros:W}, the existence of a \wit{0} allows for \ros{} which answer \qWhyV{} to be constrained by answers to \qHowV{}, even if the relevant \wit{0} occurs at some point prior to the event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
% \end{note}

  % \begin{argument}{prop:phi-always-how}
  %   Suppose \(e\) is the event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
  %   By \autoref{prop:ros-always-answer} established that the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) is always an answer to \qWhyV{}.
  %   So, Clause~\ref{q:how:v:a} is satisfied.

  %   Likewise, by assumption \(e\) is the event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
  %   Hence, by \autoref{def:witnessing}, \(e\) is a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
  %   So, Clause~\ref{q:how:v:b} is satisfied.

  %   And, as both Clause~\ref{q:how:v:a} and Clause~\ref{q:how:v:b} are satisfied, \(e\) is an answer to \qHowV{}.

  % \footnote{
  %   \phantlabel{fn:past-witness}
  %   To illustrate, consider an agent working on some mathematical problem.

  %   As part of their work on the problem the agent concludes the hypotenuse of some right-angled triangle is \(\sqrt{74}\text{cm}\) by use of the Pythagorean theorem.
  %   Further, the agent has, at some point in the past proved the Pythagorean theorem from more basic principles.

  %   Perhaps the agent concludes the hypotenuse of the triangle is \(\sqrt{74}\text{cm}\), in part, from those more basic principles.
  %   Perhaps in general it is true that if a agent concluded \(X\) from \(Y\) and \(Y\) from \(Z\), then the agent, in part at least, concluded \(X\) from \(Z\).
  %   On the other hand perhaps the more basic principles have no role explanatory role in the present.
  %   The agent only appealed to the theorem, rather than any basic principles.

  %   Though we will not take a stand on whether a relevant \wit{0} for some conclusion is distinct from the event in which the agent concludes, the first option highlights an issue with \autoref{def:witnessing}.
  %   Consider an agent working through a proof of some theorem \(\theta\), and let \(\Theta\) be the relevant \pool{}.
  %   Our interest is with the conclusion \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).

  %   Suppose the agent reasons to \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
  %   Further, suppose the \agents{} reasoning is sound.
  %   However, the agent is worried about some parts of their reasoning.
  %   Hence, given their worries, \emph{reasons} to --- but does not conclude --- \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
  %   Some time later the agent resolves their worries and concludes the theorem is true.
  %   I see no issue with the possibility that:
  %   %
  %   \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  %   \item
  %     When the agent revisited the proof, they concluded \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
  %   \item
  %     In part, a \ros{} between \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) and \(\Theta\), from the \agpe{}, answers why the agent concluded \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
  %   \item
  %     The event in which the agent reasoned to \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\) answers, in part, how the agent \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\) by being a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) and \(\Theta\).
  %   \end{itemize}
  %   %
  %   However, the idea is incompatible with the way a \wit{0} is understood.
  %   For, by the definition, an event which is a \wit{0} must be an event in which the agent \emph{concludes}.
  %   And, by construction of the \scen{0}, the \agents{} worries prevent the agent from forming the relevant conclusion.

  %   Perhaps \autoref{def:witnessing} should be revised so that an event \(e\) may be \wit{} so long as the agent adequately reasons (an optionally concludes).
  %   % However, providing an adequate characterisation of the relevant event is difficult.
  %   % That the agent \emph{reasoned} to \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\) is insufficient.
  %   % 
  %   % For example, consider a variation of the \scen{} in which the agent identifies a problem with the proof.
  %   % Given the presence of a problem, there may be no \ros{} for the agent to have a \wit{0} for.
  %   Still,
  %   % rather than attempt to characterise \ros{1} independently of conclusions,
  %   we keep the present definition of a \wit{} for simplicity.
