\chapter{\qWhyV{} and \qHowV{}}
\label{cha:var}

\begin{note}
  This chapter states variations on \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{}.
  The role of the variations is to establish a (sufficiently) precise way in which a relation may answer \qWhy{} without a corresponding answer to \qHow{}.

  Variants, rather than substitutes.
  \qWhyV{} as variant to \qWhy{} and \qHowV{} and variant to \qHow{}.
  Variants are connected to initial questions by linking conditionals.

  \begin{TOCEnum}
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:var:qwhyvnp}

    Answers to \qWhyV{} are answers to \qWhy{}.
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:var:qhowv}

    Answers to \qHow{} are answers to \qHowV{}.
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:var:issue}

    If links hold, and \issueConstraint{} holds, then this entails variant constraint.
  Provide a recepie for generating counterexamples and then either links fail, or \issueConstraint{}.
  \end{TOCEnum}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Ensuring links hold is important.
  For, \issueInclusion{} is plausibly doing work to narrow the relevant sense of why captured by \qWhy{}.

  In other words, there may be plausible answers to \qWhy{} which are not also answers to \qHow{} but fail to be counterexamples to \issueInclusion{} as the relevant sense of `why' and `how' are not the senses of `why' and `how' that \issueInclusion{} (intuitively) holds with respect to.

  And, as a constraint on answers to \qWhy{} in terms of \qHow{}, \issueInclusion{} may plausibly have a role in narrowing the relevant senses of `why' and `how' at issue.
  And, if \issueInclusion{} is rejected, then, naturally, \issueInclusion{} cannot perform this role.

  Further, to the extent that various theories of conclusion, or sufficiently related phenomena, either implicitly or explicitly endorse \issueInclusion{}, it should be the case that the same theories either implicitly or explicitly motivate the variation of \issueConstraint{} constraining answers to the variation of \qWhy{} in terms of answers to \qHow{}.

\section{\qWhyV{}}
\label{cha:var:qwhyvnp}

\begin{note}
  Recall \qWhy{}:

  \reQuestion{questionWhy}

  Rather than asking for proposition-value-premises pairings associated with explanations of `why' an agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), the variation of \qWhy{} queries which \ros{1} are such that the conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) does not happen without presence of some \ros{0}.
\end{note}

\subsection{The question}
\label{cha:var:qwhyvnp:question}

\begin{note}
  \qWhyV{} is as follows:

      %   \end{enumerate}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{question}

  

  Intuitively, without \ros{} then the conclusion does not happen.
  Alternatively, absence of \ros{} stops event from developing.

  Have an event.
  This event may be broken down into sub-events.
  Consider the way in which event developed is some sub-event had been otherwise.
  Require that there's no conclusion without \ros{}.

  \begin{notation}
  \item
    Only interested in single cases.
    So, rather than specify agent, etc.\ we write \qWhyV{}.

    When speaking abstractly, \(\phi\) \(v\) \(\Phi\) \qWhyV{} always applies to \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\).
  \end{notation}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \qWhyV{}, captures the phenomenon where it is not possible to describe \(e\) without \ros{}.

  Basic idea.
  Have an event in which the agent concludes.
  
  And, failure for something to be the case in a sub-event in certain cases blocks event from developing.

  The agent does not conclude, concludes from a different \pool{}, or concludes in a separate event.
\end{note}


\paragraph*{General form}

\begin{note}
  Consider the general form of \qWhy{} with respect to making a cup of tea.

  \begin{scenario}[A cup of tea]%
    \label{scen:cup-of-tea}%
    A moment ago I:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item
      Boiled some water.
    \item
      Placed a tea bag into a cup.
    \item
      Poured the water into the cup.
    \item
      Let the tea bag rest in the water for a while.
    \item
      Removed the tea bag.
    \end{itemize}
    I made myself a cup of tea.
  \end{scenario}

  \autoref{scen:cup-of-tea} captures an event in which I made a cup of tea.

  Suppose I forgot to place a tea bag in the cup.
  The remainder of the description still captures some event, but the end result is a cup of warm water, rather than a cup of tea.

  So, we have a sub-event.
  Parallels Clause~\ref{q:why:v:a}.

  Parallel of \itc{}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If tea bag failed to be in cup, then did not develop into an event in which I made a cup of tea.
  \end{itemize}

  So, \qWhyV{}.

  There is a straightforward sense with which the description given to the event captures \emph{how} I made a cup of tea.
  Further, there is also a sense with which the description also captures \emph{why} I made a cup of tea.

  There is also a sense with which the description fails to capture why I made a cup of tea.
  Placing a tea bag in a cup does not usually motivate making a cup of tea.%
  \footnote{
    Though we may imagine someone whose only pleasure is finding excuses to place tea bag into cups.
    (\cite[Cf.][379--380]{Rawls:1999aa})
  }

  Why the event resulted in a cup of tea versus why I wanted the event to result in a cup of tea.

  The former parallels our interest with conclusions.
  Not interested with why an agent wanted to reach a conclusion, but why an agent concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) as opposed to any other proposition-value pair, and why the agent concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\) as opposed to some other pool of premises.
\end{note}

\paragraph{A \scen{0}}

\begin{note}
  Without \ros{}, the event does not develop into an event in which the agent concludes.

  \begin{scenario}[Countersign]
    \indent The captain mumbled, ``I come from Miran.''

    The man returned the gambit, grimly.
    ``Miran is early this year.''

    The captain said, ``No earlier than last year.''

    But the man did not step aside.
    He said, ``Who are you?''

    ``Aren't you Fox?''

    ``Do you always answer by asking?''

    The captain took an imperceptibly longer breath, and then said calmly,
    ``I am Han Pritcher, Captain of the Fleet, and member of the Democratic Underground Party.
    Will you let me in?''%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[70]{Asimov:1945aa})}%
    \newline
  \end{scenario}

  Pritcher concluded the person they are talking to is a fellow member of the Democratic Underground Party via the countersign to their sign.

  So, sub-event, ``Miran is early this year'' is appropriate response to ``I come from Miran''.
  So, \ros{}.
  Goes on to conclude ``No earlier than last year'' is appropriate to respond with.
  Without first \ros{}, Pritcher does not conclude this, as not in a sign/countersign routine.

  However, keep in mind the function of \ros{} is an abstraction.
  Hot water, something that is.
  Not so with \ros{1}.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Descriptions and events}

\begin{note}
  How to evaluate something failing to hold.

  This is the description.
  Any event under description.%
  \footnote{
    This is not counterfactuals.
    Rather, what makes the counterfactual true.
    Closest world, then closeness reduces to something.
    Put that something into the description.
  }
  lawlike conditionals.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Example.

  \begin{illustration}[Coin flip]
    \label{illu:coinT}
    Agent \(B\) has accepted gable on coin toss from agent \(A\), captured by the following pair of conditionals:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item
      If the coin lands heads, then agent \(B\) gives \texteuro{}5 to agent \(A\).
    \item
      If the coin lands tails, then agent \(A\) gives \texteuro{}5 to agent \(B\).
    \end{itemize}

    Agent \(A\) has tossed the coin, but the result of the toss is hidden between agent \(A\)'s hands.
  \end{illustration}

  \autoref{illu:coinT} is a description of an event.
  And, abstracting from whatever else is true of the event described in \autoref{illu:coinT}, the following conditionals follow:

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    If the coin has landed heads, then agent \(B\) is \texteuro{}5 poorer.
  \item
    If the coin has landed tails, then agent \(A\) is \texteuro{}5 poorer.
  \end{itemize}

  These conditionals follow even if they are interpreted as material conditionals, and it just so happens to be that both \(A\) and \(B\) have been visited by a pickpocket.
  For, we may vary the presence of the pickpocket while maintaining the description of the \scen{0}, and given the gamble, the relevant transfer of wealth occurs.
  More broadly, so long as the description of the event holds, then the conditionals follow no matter what else is true of the event.

  Likewise, extend to event of \autoref{illu:coinT} so that the result of the toss has been revealed, then additional conditionals, depending on what the result of the toss was:%
  \footnote{
    Assuming the coin landed tails and heads, respectively.
  }

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    If the coin had landed heads, agent \(B\) would be \texteuro{}5 poorer.
  \item
    If the coin had landed tails, agent \(B\) would be \texteuro{}5 richer.
  \end{itemize}

  Here, the counterfactual conditionals in part follow from the gamble as specified in the initial description of \autoref{illu:coinT}.%
  \footnote{%
    \nocite{Tichy:1976tp}%
    Indeed, with respect to subjunctive conditionals, say the conditionals which specify the gamble are `laws' (\cite{Chisholm:1955aa,Lewis:1979vm,Veltman:2005tj}) or `lump together' the facts regarding the coin and relative wealth of agents \(A\) and \(B\) (\cite{Kratzer:1981aa,Kratzer:1989aa}).
  }

  Now, with respect to the definition of \qWhyV{}, the \itc{} follows from the specified description \(d\) in parallel to the way the observed conditionals follow from the description of the event as given in~\autoref{illu:coinT}.

  Though, rather than providing details about wealth, the \itc{} places a limit on whether the relevant event is an event in which the agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Our analysis of \autoref{illu:coinT} is almost okay, but is flawed.
  For, we suggested the relevant conditionals follow from the description of~\autoref{illu:coinT}.
  This is not immediate.
  For, consider adding to the description of~\autoref{illu:coinT} that agent \(A\) is dishonest, and will run before handing anything to agent \(B\), that neither agent really has \texteuro{}5 at hand and are hoping they win, or \dots
  The point is, unless description \(d\) (logically) entails description \(d'\), there is some what for description \(d\) to be true and description \(d'\) to be false.
  Hence, it may be argued that \(d'\) does not follow from \(d\).

  However, enhance the description.
  So long as there is something about the event which rules out, then add to description.
  Caveat is that this needs to constrain the way in which the event develops.
  Hence, conditional like above.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In any case, description is doing work.
  What is absent from the description is things that could otherwise have been.

  Note, implication rather than entailment.
  Background things constrain whether or not follows.

  No getting tea without hot water.

  Description may rule out possibility of helper demon, or the closet possible world where don't boil being a world in which water is stiff sufficiently warm from previous use.

  No getting conclusion without \ros{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The role of description is to allow capture things which do not just happen to be.
  In this respect, fix as much as you want.

  In this respect, limit on counterfactuals.
  Must be the case that description holds.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Observations}

\begin{note}
  \begin{observation}
    \label{obs:qWhyV-description}
    Some \ros{1} matter.
  \end{observation}
  \begin{motivation}{obs:qWhyV-description}
    Situation.
    Flip coin.
    If heads, then by understanding of arithmetic.
    If tails, then by calculator.

    Now, coin lands heads.
    Well, sure, it seems this is needed.
    However, suppose coin lands tails.
    Then the agent would decide otherwise.
    So, really, the coin flip didn't matter.

    The point is that any event, and the description didn't rule out reversing.

    Does this matter?
    Not really, expand description.
    For any problematic event which differs from the way things are, rule out with description.
  \end{motivation}

  Contrasts with countersign.
  Situation in which Pritcher forgets, both bluff.
  However, remembered in description, so build this in and continue from there.

  Whether there is something which rules out things being otherwise.

  \begin{observation}
    \label{obs:do-mai}
    Some \ros{1} do not matter.
  \end{observation}
  \begin{motivation}{obs:do-mai}
    This tea tastes cold.

    Conclusion, so \ros{}.

    Consider event in which agent concludes.
    Unless deterministic and build in everything, then consider event in which agent doesn't take a sip.
    Does not conclude.
    Still concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    For, so much focus didn't even go for tea.
  \end{motivation}
\end{note}

\subsection{Link}
\label{cha:var:qwhyvnp:link}

\begin{note}
  We developed \qWhyV{} through the idea that:

  If an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) depends on a \ros{1} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) holding, for the agent, then the \ros{1} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) explains, in part, why the agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  The connexion between dependence and explanation of why links \qWhyV{} and \qWhy{} in the following way:

  \begin{link}[\qWhyV{} and \qWhy{}]
    \label{link:why:support:pvpp}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Proposition: \(\phi\)
      \item
        Value: \(v\)
      \item
        \pool{2}: \(\Phi\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{itemize*}
    }
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        A \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is, in part, an answer to \qWhyV{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume]
      \item
        \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is, in part, an answer to \qWhy{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{link}

  In short, \linkW{} states that dependence captured by \qWhyV{} is sufficient to explain why an agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Though, given the discussion of entanglement in \autoref{cha:var:qwhyvnp:question}, we take the conditional and to be implicitly restricted by some commonsense.

  We will have no interest in the converse of \linkW{}.
  And, there may be cases in which \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) answers, in part, \qWhy{} while there is no corresponding \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) that answers, in part, \qWhyV{}.
  Indeed, \qWhy{} is not restricted to \ros{1}.

  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:ros-always-answer}
    By \supportI{}, a \ros{} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for the agent, when the agent pairs \(\phi\) with \(v\) as a sub-event of an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

    Hence, by restricting \qWhyV{} to the sub-event, we ensure that the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) holds, for the agent, and so may answer, in part, \qWhyV{}.

    And, the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is guaranteed to be an answer to \qWhyV{} because, if the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) did not hold, for the agent, then the relevant event would be an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

    In short, depends on description, and failure of \ros{} to hold blocks development.

    Suppose \(d\) only captures conclusion.
    Now, over determined.


    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Suppose coin flip.
      In the style of \citeauthor{Tichy:1976tp}.
      Here, the coin flip makes no difference.

      For, consider a \scen{0} in which an agent concludes \(23 \times 15 = 345\) from their understanding of arithmetic, such that some time shortly before the agent did the calculation, the agent concluded it would be good to brew a cup of tea.

      Intuitively it should not be the case that the \ros{} and the conclusion that it would be good to get some coffee answers, in part, why the agent concluded some theorem is true from some \pool{}.
      Though, it may well be the case that the agent would have been too tired to conclude the theorem without the aid of the coffee.%
      \footnote{
        \citeauthor{Armstrong:1968vh} (\citeyear[195--196]{Armstrong:1968vh}) discusses a similar example, and suggests further discussion of this issue may also be found in \textcite{Moore:1962up}.

  Still, we will proceed with \qWhyV{}.

  Motivated:
  Theory neutral.

  The imprecision arising from the \itc{} is in part by design.

  We noted above that the sense of dependence captured by the \itc{} is not, in general, tightly connected to answering why questions.
  And, ideally, we would have a detailed account of the connexion between conclusions and \ros{1} which clarifies when link, captured by the conditional, between~\ref{q:why:v:if} and~\ref{q:why:v:then} holds.
  Still, we abstracted to \ros{1} to avoid any detailed account of what it is for an agent to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  Hence, the abstracting to a conditional allows the relevant link between~\ref{q:why:v:if} and~\ref{q:why:v:then} to be developed in accordance with specific details given by some account of what concluding amounts to.

\section{\qHowV{}}
\label{cha:var:qhowv}

\begin{note}
  \qHow{} is a broad question which asks, quite generally, for an account of how an agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) in terms of what has happened.
  Recall:

  \reQuestion{questionHow}

  As with \qWhy{} and \qWhyV{}, `\qHowV{}' refers to the variation of \qHow{}.

          \begin{itemize}
          \item
            There exists an event \(e'\) such that \(e'\) is a \wit{0} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).

\subsection{Link}
\label{cha:var:qhowv:sec:link}

\begin{note}
    Now, from \autoref{prop:phi-always-how} we have that the event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is always an answer to \qHowV{}.
  However, the way in which \qHowV{} queries `how' an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is highly imprecise.

  For \qHowV{} searches for any \wit{}.
  The key, however, is that we are guaranteed to at least have the event.

  Further, so long as the agent has \wit{} for \ros{} which answers \qWhyV{}, then that event is answer to \qHowV{}.

  Still, \qHow{} is not of direct interest.
  Instead, \issueInclusion{}.
  Constrain that \qHow{} places on \qWhy{}.

  As \qHowV{} is weaker than \qHow{}, weaker constraint.
  And, as we are looking for counterexamples, this restricts possible counterexamples.

\section{\issueConstraint{}}
\label{cha:var:issue}

\begin{note}
  In~\autoref{cha:var:qwhyvnp} we developed \qWhyV{}, a variation of \qWhy{}.
  And, in~\autoref{cha:var:qhowv} we developed \qHowV{}, a variation of \qHow{}.
  In both sections we established links between the variant --- \qWhyV{}, \qHowV{}  --- and initial --- \qWhy{}, \qHow{} --- questions.

  Indeed, the purpose of developing the variant questions is to clarify the initial questions to a sufficient degree so that counterexamples to the intuitive constraint between the initial questions --- \issueInclusion{} --- may be developed.

  In this section, we bring together the variant and initial questions and \issueInclusion{} to state, in some detail, how everything fits together.
\end{note}

    Suppose \qWhyV{} is answered, in part, by a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
    From~\linkW{} it is immediately follows that \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) answers, in part, \qWhy{}.
    And, given \issueInclusion{}, \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) answers, in part, \qHow{}.

\begin{note}
  As~\autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} follows from \linkW{}, \linkH{}, and \issueInclusion{}, we consider the content of~\autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} to be a parallel constraint to \issueInclusion{}:

  \begin{constraint}{consConstraint}{\issueConstraint{}}

      \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}

        Propositions: \(\phi\), \(\psi\)
      \item
        Values: \(v\), \(v'\)
      \item

    \begin{itemize}

      \qWhyV{} is answered, in part, by a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{Only if}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \qHowV{} is answered, in part, by \vAgent{}' \wit{0} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{constraint}

  As with \issueInclusion{}, if \issueConstraint{} holds, then answers to \qWhyV{} are constrained by answers to \qHowV{}.

  Our direct goal is to develops counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.
  For, if there are counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}, then it immediately follows by \autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} that either \linkW{}, \linkH{}, or \issueInclusion{} fails to hold.

  We defended \linkW{} when developing \qWhyV{} in~\autoref{cha:var:qwhyvnp}.
  And, likewise, we defended \linkH{} when developing \qHowV{} in~\autoref{cha:var:qhowv}.
  And, though there are some difficulties with \qWhyV{}, \qHowV{}, \linkW{}, and \linkH{}, I consider the most plausible point of failure to be \issueInclusion{}.
\end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   Still, \issueConstraint{} may be considered as a direct constraint on answers to \qWhyV{} in terms of answers to \qHow{}.
%   In particular, \autoref{prop:constraint-rewrite} expands our construction of \qWhyV{}  and \qHowV{} to provide an alternative statement of \issueConstraint{}.

  % \begin{proposition}[\issueConstraint{}, rewritten]
  %   \label{prop:constraint-rewrite}
  %   For an agent \vAgent{}, proposition-value pairs \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\), and \pool{1} \(\Phi\), \(\Psi\):

  %   \issueConstraint{} is equivalent to the following conditional:

  %   \begin{enumerate}
  %   \item[\emph{If}:]
  %     \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
  %     \item
  %       \label{constraint-rewrite:a}
  %       \vAgent{} concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  %     \end{enumerate}
  %   \item[\emph{And}:]
  %     \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume]
  %     \item
  %       \label{constraint-rewrite:b}
  %       \vAgent{} would not have concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), if a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) failed to hold, from \agpe{\vAgent{}'}.
  %     \end{enumerate}
  %   \item[\emph{Then}:]
  %     \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume]
  %     \item
  %       \label{constraint-rewrite:c}
  %       \vAgent{} has a \wit{0} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
  %     \end{enumerate}
  %   \end{enumerate}
  %   \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  % \end{proposition}
  % %
  % \begin{argument}{prop:constraint-rewrite}
  %   Immediate by \autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} and the construction to \qWhyV{} and \qHowV{}.

  %   The antecedent of the conditional~---~\ref{constraint-rewrite:a}~\&~\ref{constraint-rewrite:b}~---~correspond to a \ros{} being, in part, an answer to \qWhyV{} while the consequent~---~\ref{constraint-rewrite:c}~---~corresponds to the \wit{0} which answers, in part, \qHowV{}.
  %   The conditional then follows from \autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing}.
  % \end{argument}

%   So, directly, \issueConstraint{} amounts to the constraint that in order for an \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) to depend on some \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\), the agent must have concluded \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).

\section{Summary}
\label{cha:var:summary}

\begin{note}
  Overall argument.
  Links then answer to \qWhyV{} which is not constrained by \qHowV{}, then \issueInclusion{} fails.

  Three broad ways in which the overall argument may fail:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*), noitemsep]
  \item
    The link between \qWhyV{} and \qWhy{} fails to hold.
  \item
    The link between \qHowV{} and \qHow{} fails to hold.
  \item
    We fail to develop counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.
  \end{enumerate}

  Still, I hope to have developed \qWhyV{}, \qHowV{}, and \issueConstraint{} in such a way that both questions are of some interest independent of link

  In \autoref{cha:clar:sec:literature} we suggest how a handful of accounts of conclusion, or related, may be understood in terms of \qWhyV{} and \qHowV{}, and how the accounts motivate \issueConstraint{} as a constraint on answers to \qWhyV{} in terms of answers to \qHowV{}.

% \section{The role of variant questions}
% \label{cha:var:sec:wiggling}

% \begin{note}
%   \autoref{cha:introduction} introduced \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{}.


%   The overall goal of this document is to argue \issueInclusion{} does not hold.

%   Hence, without establishing a clear understanding of the way in which the instances are to be understood, it is unclear how to develop counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   In broad outline, we use the idea of a `\ros{0}' to provide variations on \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{}.
%   The way in which we understand \ros{1} is minimal and tightly connected to an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
%   Specifically, we put forward three ideas in relation to \ros{1}:
%   \begin{enumerate}
%   \item
%     If an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), then a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for the agent, when the agent pairs \(\phi\) with \(v\).
%   \item
%     If an agent has concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), then the event in which the agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) functions as a \wit{0} for a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
%   \item
%     It is possible for a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) to hold, from an \agpe{}, without their being an \wit{0} for the \ros{0}.
%   \end{enumerate}

%   \autoref{cha:var:ros} will develop and discuss each idea in detail.

%   For the moment, the motivation for abstracting to \ros{1} is to capture, in a abstract way, the way in which \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) are related from an \agpe{} when the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

%   Rather than directly capturing some relevant sense of `why' or `how' our goal is to use \ros{1} to construct variations on \qWhy{} and \qHow{} which are \emph{roughly} `extensionally adequate'.
%   Where, we understand the term `extensionally adequate' more-or-less in line with \citeauthor{Sumner:1987aa} (\citeyear{Sumner:1987aa}):

%   \begin{quote}
%     [A] conception of a concept is extensionally adequate when it includes every item which seems pre-analytically to be an instance of the concept and excludes every item which does not.%
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[49]{Sumner:1987aa})}
%   \end{quote}

%   Adapted to our case, our interest with \qWhy{} and \qHow{} is with respect to intuitive answers to \qWhy{} and \qHow{} (and in particular the intuition that \issueInclusion{} holds).
%   And, the variations of both \qWhy{} and \qHow{} may be seen as `conceptions of a question' such that any answer to \qWhy{} is an answer to the variation of \qWhy{}, vice-versa, and the same with respect to \qHow{}.

%   Still, the way in which something answers \qWhy{} need not be equivalent to the way in which that thing answers the variation to \qWhy{}.%
%   \footnote{
%     In this respect, the variation to \qWhy{} need not be \emph{intensionally} adequate.
%     Where the variation of \qWhy{} (or \qHow{}) would be intensionally adequate just in case the variation captured the way something \emph{intuitively} answers \qWhy{}.
%   }

%   And, we are only interested in `rough' extensional adequacy.
%   In particular, we are only interested in answers to \qWhy{} and \qHow{} to the extent that \issueInclusion{} plausibly holds.
%   Hence, we will ignore intuitive answers to \qWhy{} and \qHow{} which extend beyond \issueInclusion{}.

%   Further, to the extent that \issueInclusion{} is intuitive, the variations \emph{may} conflict with this intuition.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   With the aid of \ros{1} we develop variations of \qWhy{} and \qHow{}:

%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     Interpret `why' from \qWhy{} in terms of the \ros{1} the \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) depended on.
%   \item
%     Interpret `how' from \qHow{} in terms of events which \wit{0} any \ros{} that the \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) depended on.
%   \end{itemize}

%   % So, the variation to \qWhy{} is expected to be extensionally adequate for:

%   % If conclusion does not depend on \ros{}, then plausible that it is possible to answer \qWhy{} without citing the proposition-value-premises pairing.
%   % For, event would have occurred regardless of whether paired.

%   % If conclusion does depend on \ros{}, then proposition-value-premises pairing answers, in part, \qWhy{}.
%   % For, event would not have occurred regardless of whether paired.

%   % Variation to \qHow{}.
%   % Developed with respect to variation on \qWhy{}.

%   % If \ros{}, then if event \wit{} \ros{}, then of interest.
%   % If event which does not lead to \ros{}, then event is of no interest.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   An significant consequence of both variations will be as follows:

%     When an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\):
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%       The \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) depends on a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) holding, for the agent.
%     \item
%       The event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) serves as a \wit{0} for the \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
%     \end{itemize}
%   \end{itemize}
%   Hence, a \ros{} between \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) will always be, in part, an answer to the variation of \qWhy{} and the event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) will always be, in part, an answer to the variation of \qHow{}.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   A variant to \issueInclusion{} follows from the variations to \qWhy{} and \qHow{}.
%   Roughly:

%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     A conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) depends on some \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) holding for the agent

%     \emph{Only if}:

%     The agent has a \wit{} for the \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   With an initial understanding of the variations to \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{} in hand, we now return to the overall argument of this document.
%   Our goal is to develop counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
%   And, given the variation to \issueInclusion{} which follows from the variations to \qWhy{} and \qHow{}, we will do so by showing there are cases in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) such that:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     The agent pairing \(\phi\) and \(v\) depended on a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) holding, for the agent.
%   \item
%     The agent did not have a \wit{0} for the \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) when the agent paired \(\phi\) and \(v\).
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
  % As with \qWhyV{} our interest is with extensional adequacy, and specifically extensional adequacy with respect to \ros{1}.

  % Consider any event.
  % There are two cases.
  % \ros{} which answers \qWhyV{} or no \ros{}.

  % If no \ros{} then the \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) does not depend on what happened.
  % Hence, event is not of direct interest with respect to answering `how' an agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  % If \ros{} which \qWhyV{}, then included as an answer to \qHowV{}.

  % So, though we have abstracted to \ros{1} to avoid any account of what conclusion amounts to, the existence of a \wit{0} intuitively captures whatever it is of relevance that happened when the agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  % And, as discussed in \autoref{cha:var:ros:W}, the existence of a \wit{0} allows for \ros{} which answer \qWhyV{} to be constrained by answers to \qHowV{}, even if the relevant \wit{0} occurs at some point prior to the event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
% \end{note}

  % \begin{argument}{prop:phi-always-how}
  %   Suppose \(e\) is the event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
  %   By \autoref{prop:ros-always-answer} established that the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) is always an answer to \qWhyV{}.
  %   So, Clause~\ref{q:how:v:a} is satisfied.

  %   Likewise, by assumption \(e\) is the event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
  %   Hence, by \autoref{def:witnessing}, \(e\) is a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
  %   So, Clause~\ref{q:how:v:b} is satisfied.

  %   And, as both Clause~\ref{q:how:v:a} and Clause~\ref{q:how:v:b} are satisfied, \(e\) is an answer to \qHowV{}.
