\section{\fc{3}}
\label{sec:fc3}


\begin{note}
  To what extent does the substance of the argument given rely on \fc{1}?

  The idea is central.

  However, \qWhy{}  only concerns \ros{1}.

  Function of \fc{1} is to get \ros{} without \wit{}.
  In turn, appeal to \fc{1} when defining \requ{1} and so on is to have something which gets \ros{}.

  Possible that something other than a \fc{} does this work.
  Indeed, what matters is whatever it is that ensures \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) is a \fc{} from \(\Phi\), rather than \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) \emph{being} a \fc{} from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}



\subsection{Additional upshots}


\begin{note}
  Second, agency.

  \tCV{}, then agency.

  Else, it's accidental to what the agent is doing that they're \tCV{}.
  And, in some cases I think this may be right, but not in general.

  The agent \emph{is} \tCV{}.
  It is not merely the case that the agent \emph{happens to be} \tCV{}.
\end{note}




\section{Other agents}
\label{sec:other-agents}


\begin{note}
  Mathematic proofs and transferability.

  To get \requ{1}, focused on \tC{}.
  However, other properties that constrain whether reasoning is of some type.
  If these get \ros{}, then answers to \qWhy{} expand further.
