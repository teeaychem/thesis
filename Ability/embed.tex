\begin{note}
  Main argument appeals to \tCV{}.
  This is to secure pressure.

  However, not required.
  \requ{} is enough.

  Question about whether this happens.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Well, the main argument focuses on \tCV{}.

  However, something more general?

  Something from the \agpe{}.

  Difficult, as worries about whether the \agpe{} is correct.

  However, more general.

  In this section, groundwork.
  First, plausible that \agpe{} matters.
  Second, interesting feature of \requ{}.

\section{\ninf{2}}
\label{sec:infl}

\begin{note}
  Consider the following \scen{0}:

  \begin{scenario}[Apples]%
    \label{scen:apples}%
    Grey is walking to town.
    Grey notices a bicycle for sale.
    Grey purchases the bicycle, gets on the bicycle, and starts cycling to town.
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  The basic structure of \autoref{scen:apples} is simple:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    An initial event is in progress. \hfill (Grey is walking to town.)
  \item
    Some other event happens. \hfill (Grey notices and purchases the bicycle.)
  \item
    The initial event is not longer in progress. \hfill (Grey is cycling to town.)
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent%
  Our interest is with the detail:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The initial event is not longer in progress due to an action the agent performed.
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent%
  When an agent stops an event in progress by performing some action, we say the agent exerted `\ninf{}' over the initial event.
  Hence, Grey exerted `\ninf{}' over whether or not they were walking to town.

  Still, an agent does not need to exert \ninf{} to have \ninf{}.
  Grey may have continued walking to town after noticing the bicycle for sale.

  We define an agent having \ninf{} over an event as follows:

  \begin{definition}[\ninf{2}]
    \label{def:ninf}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{VAREnum}
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Event: \(e\)
      \item
        Event description: \(\alpha\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{VAREnum}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \vAgent{} has \ninf{} over whether or not \(\text{Prog}(e, \alpha)\) is true.
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Both~\ref{def:ninf:action} and~\ref{def:ninf:prog} are true:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{def:ninf:action}
        There is some action \(b\) that \vAgent{} may (immediately) do.
      \item
        \label{def:ninf:prog}
        \(\text{Prog}(e', \alpha)\) would be not be true if \vAgent{} does \(b\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  Applied to \autoref{scen:apples}:

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    The agent is Grey.
  \item
    The event \(e\) spans some period of time which starts when or after Grey set out for town, and includes Grey noticing the bicycle for sale.
  \item
    \(\alpha\) is the description `Grey walks to town'.
  \item
    An instance of \(b\) is the action `Grey purchases and rides the bicycle'.
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent%
  Of course, with additional detail given, other actions may satisfy \(b\) action of \autoref{def:ninf}.
  For example, Grey may have turned back home or raided the local orchard.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The following table lists a few additional examples of \ninf{0}:

  \begin{center}
    \bgroup
    \def\arraystretch{1.125}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      Event description \(\alpha\) & Action \(b\) \\
      \hline
      Finish a book late at night. & Turn off the lights. \\
      Listen to a (full) speech. & Leave before the speech is over. \\
      Play a game of chess. & Flip the board in frustration.
    \end{tabular}
    \egroup
  \end{center}

  \noindent%
  Having \ninf{} over whether or not event is in progress is common, but there are also various events an agent does not have \ninf{} over.
  Here, event description and background condition which blocks.

    \begin{center}
    \bgroup
    \def\arraystretch{1.125}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      Event description \(\alpha\) & Background condition \\
      \hline
      Take a shower. & Has been in the shower for a while. \\
      Play chequers & Has made a few moves. \\
      A bank robbery & Is in prison. \\
    \end{tabular}
    \egroup
  \end{center}

  \noindent%
  We briefly comment on the first two examples:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If you've been in the shower for a while, then whatever happens it remains the case that you were taking a shower.
  \item
    Likewise, if you have made a few moves, then what events it remains the case you were playing chequers.
    The contrast between playing chequers and playing a game of chess is the scope of the event.
    One may play chequers (or chess) without playing a full game of chequers (or chess).
  \end{itemize}

  \nocite{Peacocke:2021aa}%
  \ninf{2} is a general phenomenon.
  Our specific interest in with whether an agent has \ninf{} over whether they are \emph{concluding} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  In particular, \requ{1} rely on an agent having \ninf{} over concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  Still, before turning to \requ{1} we establish there are cases in which has \ninf{} over concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  \begin{proposition}[\ninf{2} over concluding]%
    \label{prop:ninfConcl}%
    There are instances in which an agent exerts \ninf{0} over whether or not they are concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:ninfConcl}
    Consider an agent \vAgent{}, some proposition-value pair \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), \pool{} \(\Phi\), and event \(e\).

    We make two observations:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*), noitemsep]
    \item
      By \assuPP{2}, in order for \(e\) to be an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), there must be some \progAdj{0} development \(e^{\sharp}\) of \(e\) such that \(e^{\sharp}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \item
      There are often actions which if performed by \vAgent{} would result in an event \(e^{+}\), where \(e^{+}\) is a development of \(e\), and there is no \progAdj{0} development of \(e^{+}\) in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

      In particular it may be the case that:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
        \label{prop:ninfConcl:obs:2:concludes}
      \item
        \(e^{+}\) does not develop into an event in which \vAgent{} \emph{concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\)}.
      \item
        \label{prop:ninfConcl:obs:2:diffPoll}
        \(e^{+}\) does develop into an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) \emph{from \(\Phi\)}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    \noindent%
    We illustrate \ref{prop:ninfConcl:obs:2:concludes} and \ref{prop:ninfConcl:obs:2:diffPoll} turn:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Suppose \vAgent{} is playing a game of chess against an opponent.
      The opponent claims checkmate, and \vAgent{} beings to determine whether or not they are in checkmate.

      Still, \vAgent{} may flip the board, scattering pieces everywhere.
      And, with pieces scattered everywhere, \vAgent{} does not have sufficient resources to determine whether or not they were in checkmate.

      Hence, while determining whether or not they are in checkmate, \vAgent{} has \ninf{} over whether they are concluding they are in checkmate.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Suppose \vAgent{} is working on a homework problem which asks for solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0\).
      \vAgent{} starts to work on the problem via factorisation, and is making slow, but steady, progress.

      Still, \vAgent{} understands the quadratic formula.
      And, \vAgent{} may use the quadratic formula to solve the quadratic equation.
      However, if \vAgent{} uses the quadratic formula, the relevant \pool{} \(\Phi\) must expand to include the details regarding the quadratic formula.

      Hence, while working on the quadratic equation, \vAgent{} has \ninf{} over whether they are concluding \(x = 1\) or \(x = -\sfrac{1}{2}\) from \(\Phi\).
      For, the agent may turn to concluding \(x = 1\) or \(x = -\sfrac{1}{2}\) from some expanded or variant \pool{} \(\Phi'\).
    \end{itemize}

    Abstracting a little:
    There are cases in which there is nothing which prevents an agent from making unavailable some proposition-value pair necessary for the agent to reach some conclusion.
    And, there are cases in which an agent may chose to appeal to additional proposition-value pairs in order to reach a conclusion.%
    \footnote{
      It does not follow the agent had a choice over how event develops, if the agent does not exert \ninf{}.
      It may be that if the agent continued the event, they would have concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      And, may remain the case that \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is a \fc{}.
    }
  \end{argument}

\section{\ninf{2}, \requ{1}, and agency}
\label{sec:ninf2-requ1-agency}

\begin{note}
  Plausible that get \ninf{} due to \requ{}.

  Here, return to SQUISH.

  Did everything from a third person perspective.

  However, agent adopts this perspective.

  Look, who know what really happens.
  But, this seems quite reasonable.
\end{note}

\section{Embeeeeeee}
\label{sec:embeeeeeee}

\begin{note}
  In this chapter we return to \ros{1} in order to introduce and discuss a useful feature of abstracting to \ros{1} which we term `embedding'.

  Embedding have two functions in this document.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Specify a concern regarding the counterexamples that we will develop to \issueConstraint{}.
  \item
    Capture additional accounts of events in which an agent concludes form the literature.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  If you decide to read this chapter, it is split into three sections:

  \begin{TOCEnum}
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:var:ros:Emb}

    Introduce distinction, define, and intuition.
  \item
    \TOCLine{sec:wrangling}

    The concern.
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:var:sec:embedding}

    A handful of accounts from the literature.
  \end{TOCEnum}
\end{note}

\subsection{Embedding \ros{1}}
\label{cha:var:ros:Emb}



\subsection{Embedding \requ{1}}
\label{sec:wrangling}

\begin{note}
  Interest with embedding is the following proposition:

  \begin{proposition}
    If embedded, then does not answer \qWhyV{}.
  \end{proposition}

  Distinction between \ros{} answering \qWhyV{} and a \ros{} being embedded in some \ros{}

  Now:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If \requ{}, then why not embed \fc{} as a premise.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Problem.
  Plausibly remains a \requ{}.
  For, failure to reason is still a problem.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Example}
\label{sec:example}

\begin{note}
  Squish is a great example, as I plausibly rely on my memory of a prior proof.
  Indeed, I am not inclined to think about this for proofs I have no done at some point in the past.
\end{note}

\subsection{Embedding in the literature}
\label{cha:var:sec:embedding}

\begin{note}
  So, in initial cases, plausible that constraint in terms of having a \wit{}.

  In other cases, embedding.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  An initial borderline case is \citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa}'s taking condition.
  Depending on how `taking' is understood, embedded within \ros{}.
  In particular, distinguished proposition-value pairs from attitudes, and hence this does not amount to reducing the taking condition to a doxastic condition.
\end{note}

\subsection*{\textcite{Thomson:1965vv}}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Thomson:1965vv} suggests a an account of reasoning such that an agent reasons from \(\phi\) to \(\psi\) just in case the agent believes that \(\phi\) is a reason for \(\psi\).
  \begin{quote}
    The claim which the 'formula' of p.\ 285\nolinebreak
    \footnote{
      The `formula' in question:
      \begin{quote}
        Now reasoning should surely involve drawing a conclusion from a set of premisses.
        But you can't be said to draw the conclusion that \emph{q} from \emph{p} if for all you know in knowing that \emph{p} it would at best be a matter of luck if \emph{q} as well.
        So to ``reason'' from \emph{p} by itself to \emph{q} isn't really to be reasoning; it's like saying one thing, and then taking a chance on it that something else is also true---like taking a leap in the dark, or more prosaically, like guessing.'
        (From here on I shall refer to this as the `\emph{formula}'.)\nolinebreak
        \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[285]{Thomson:1965vv})}
      \end{quote}
    }
    above was to support was this:
    suppose \emph{p} does not imply \emph{q}, and suppose a man says `\emph{p}, so \emph{q}';
    then he is not reasoning in saying this unless he believes that \emph{r}, where the conjunction of \emph{p} and \emph{r} implies \emph{q}, and \emph{r} is a suppressed premiss of his reasoning.\par
    But suppose such a man believes that \emph{p} is reason for \emph{q}; would this not be enough?
    `It would if ``\emph{p} is reason for \emph{q}'' were construed as a suppressed premiss of his argument'.
    Then let us so construe it.%
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[294]{Thomson:1965vv})}
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\subsection*{\textcite{Longino:1978wv}}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Longino:1978wv}'s (\citeyear{Longino:1978wv}) account of inferring seems explicit.
  \begin{quote}
    S infers at t that p from x if and only if
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item
      S at t comes to believe that p, and
    \item
      S's epistemic reason for believing that p at t is x, i.e.,
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
      \item
        S takes x to be evidence that p, and
      \item
        S's taking x to be evidence that p causes S to believe that p.\newline
        \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[22]{Longino:1978wv})}

  \end{quote}
  Causation between mental states, but explanatory relation between things.
\end{note}

% \subsection{\citeauthor{Owens:2006tw}}

% \begin{note}
%   For example, \citeauthor{Owens:2006tw} argues for a belief expression model of assertion in which the rationality of a belief formed by an agent via testimony is connected to justification of the testifier:

%   \begin{quote}
%     Trusting an expression of belief by accepting what a speaker says involves entering a state of mind which gets its rationality from the rationality of the belief expressed.
%     This state's rationality depends on the speaker's justification for the belief he expresses, not on his justification for the action of expressing it.
%     And to hear a speaker as making a sincere assertion, as expressing a belief, is \emph{ceteris paribus} to feel able to tap into \emph{that} justification (whether or not his assertion was directed at you) by accepting what he says.%
%     \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[123]{Owens:2006tw})}
%   \end{quote}

%   On the view advanced by \citeauthor{Owens:2006tw}, justification.
%   View in terms of \support{}.

%   \support{} directly.
%   Rationality of agent is rationality of speaker.

%   However, `depends'.

%   Distinction between rationality of state, and relation between rationality of state and rationality of state.

%   Inclined to think \citeauthor{Owens:2006tw} is arguing for the former.%
%   \footnote{
%     \begin{quote}
%       If we are to believe what the speaker indicates he believes, either the speaker must justify this belief to us, or we must supply some justification of our own
%       [\dots]
%       Neither act can be part of a rationality preserving mechanism for belief.%
%       \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[123--124]{Owens:2006tw})}
%     \end{quote}
%   }
%   Though, it is not clear to me that embedded isn't a viable option.

%   Regardless, distinction that is important.
