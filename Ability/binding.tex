\subsection{\requ{3} and \qWhyV{}}

\begin{note}

    \label{prop:requ-WhyV}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}

      \item
        Values: \(v\), \(v'\)
      \item
        \pool{3}: \(\Phi\), \(\Psi\)
      \item
        Events: \(e\), \(e^{\flat}\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{itemize*}
    }

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      The \rCon{0} hold of \(e\) with respect to \(\langle \vAgent{}, \pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}, \pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}, e^{\flat} \rangle\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\), in part, answers \qWhyV{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:requ-WhyV}
    Suppose the \rCon{0} hold of \(e\) with respect to \(\langle \vAgent{}, \pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}, \pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}, e^{\flat} \rangle\).

    From Condition~\ref{def:rCs:C}, concludes.
    So, \qWhyV{} applies.

    Our task is to show the conditional of \qWhyV{} is true.

    From~\ref{def:rCs:Cing} of the \rCon{}, we have some sub-event \(e^{\flat}\) of \(e\) such that \ref{def:rCs:Cing:itc} and \ref{def:rCs:Cing:requ} jointly hold.

    Consider the event \(e^{\flat}\) and assume a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) fails to hold for \vAgent{} through \(e^{\flat}\).

    \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-pot-support} (\autopageref{prop:fcs-only-if-pot-support}) established:

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is a \fc{0} from \(\Psi\) for \vAgent{} throughout \(e^{\sharp}\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      A \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) holds for \vAgent{} throughout \(e^{\sharp}\).
    \end{itenum}

    \noindent%
    So, by our assumption \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) not a \fc{0} from \(\Psi\) for \vAgent{} throughout \(e^{\flat}\).

    Now, by Sub-condition~\ref{def:rCs:Cing:requ} of the \rCon{}, \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of \(e^{\flat}\) being an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    And, by expanding the definition of a \requ{} (\autopageref{def:requ}):

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) is a \fc{} for \vAgent{}.
    \end{itenum}

    \noindent%
    Hence, \(e\) is not an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

    Therefore, by Sub-condition \ref{def:rCs:Cing:itc}, \(e^{\flat}\) is not, or does not develop into, an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Key.

  Intuition is that \tC{}.
  Therefore, matters whether or not \fc{}.
  Hence, matters whether or not \ros{}.
\end{note}

\subsection{\requ{3} and \issueConstraint{}}
\label{cha:binding:sec:requ-iC}

\begin{note}
  With \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV} we observe the way in which the \rCon{0} may provide counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.

  In short, we need some instance in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) such that \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of the agent concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), yet the agent does not have a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Psi\).

  In full:

  \begin{proposition}[\requ{3} and \issueConstraint{}]
    \label{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Propositions: \(\phi\), \(\psi\)
      \item
        Values: \(v\), \(v'\)
      \item
        \pool{3}: \(\Phi\), \(\Psi\)
      \item
        Events: \(e\), \(e^{\flat}\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{itemize*}
    }

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      The \rCon{0} hold of \(e\) with respect to \(\langle \vAgent{}, \pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}, \pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}, e^{\flat} \rangle\).
    \item[\emph{And}:]
      \label{prop:requ-WhyVCes:noW}
      \vAgent{} does not have a \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Psi\) when \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a counterexample to \issueConstraint{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}
    More-or-less immediate.

    If the \rCon{0} hold of \(e\) with respect to \(\langle \vAgent{}, \pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}, \pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}, e^{\flat} \rangle\), then \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\), in part, answers \qWhyV{}, given~\autoref{prop:requ-WhyV}.
    And, granting \vAgent{} does not have a \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Psi\) when \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), this immediately contradicts \issueConstraint{}.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces} does not guarantee the existence of counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.
  And, as we were careful not to presuppose counterexamples to \issueConstraint{} when developing \tC{0}, \fc{1}, and \requ{1}, we have no yet seen any explicit counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.

  In \autoref{cha:ces} we will provide examples which satisfy the conditions of \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The existence of \requ{1} are compatible with \issueConstraint{}.

  \begin{observation}%
    \label{prop:requ-not-n-ce}%
    \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV} is compatible with \issueConstraint{}.
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{prop:requ-not-n-ce}
    \requ{3} are about an agent concluding.
    \fc{} when the agent concludes.
    An agent may fail to have a \wit{} for \fc{}.

    However, \issueConstraint{}, \wit{} when the agent concludes.
    Therefore, so long as \wit{} when the agent concludes, fine.

    Two possibilities.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Agent already has a \wit{}.

      For example, first \scen{0}.
      If concluding sequence, \fc{}.
      Prior to getting \(L_{8}\), \fc{}.

      However, expectation of \wit{} when sequence.
      Indeed, \(L_{9}\) from \(L_{8} + L_{7}\).
    \item
      Agent obtains \wit{} prior to conclusion.

      Consider \autoref{scen:squish}.
      The agent has previously concluded \sqE{} is sound.
      Therefore, the agent has a \wit{} for \ros{}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{motivation}

  Note, however, that \autoref{prop:requ-not-n-ce} is weak.
  Compatible in terms of existential.
  Hence we only needed to show a single case in which \wit{} for \requ{}.
  This does not suggest that \requ{1} are not in tension with \issueConstraint{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{observation}
    \label{obs:denyCing}
    Deny that needed to be the case agent was concluding.
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{obs:denyCing}
    \qWhyV{} is about developing.
    If it does not need to be the case that the agent is concluding, then it is possible for the agent to conclude.
  \end{motivation}

  In part, this ensures we don't get anything that is clearly redundant.

  In general, possible to deny.
  But, I don't think it is viable in many cases.
  Agent is concluding.
  The conclusion does not `happen'.

  This is hand wavy.
  Idea of an agent \tCV{} addresses this.
\end{note}

\section{\tC{2} and \issueConstraint{}}
\label{sec:tpyically-concluding}

\begin{note}
  Understand \requ{} and counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.

  Introduced \tCV{} to motivate \requ{}.
