\chapter{Mix}
\label{cha:binding}

\begin{note}
  \autoref{cha:intro} introduced two questions, \qWhy{} and \qHow{}, and motivated a constraint between answers to \qWhy{} and \qHow{}.

  \autoref{cha:var:sec:vars} introduced \qWhyV{} and \qHowV{}, and a variant constraint.

  \fc{}, and \requ{}.

  In this chapter, link \fc{1} and \requ{1} to \qWhyV{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Chapter introduced \requ{1}.
  \requ{3} focus on some concrete stuff: \fc{1}.

  However, \qWhyV{} is stated with respect to \ros{}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \autoref{cha:requs} introduced \requ{1}.
  In this chapter, link \requ{1} to \qWhyV{}.

\section{\requ{3} and \ros{1}}
\label{cha:binding:sec:requRos}

\begin{note}
  We being by observing a key way in which \requ{1} interact with \ros{1}:

  \begin{proposition}[\requ{3} and \ros{1}]
    \label{prop:requ-ros}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Propositions: \(\phi\), \(\psi\)
      \item
        Values: \(v\), \(v'\)
      \item
        \pool{3}: \(\Phi\), \(\Psi\)
      \item
        Event: \(e\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{itemize*}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) \requ{} of \(e\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \begin{itemize}
      \item[\emph{If}:]
        A \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) fails to hold, for \vAgent{}, through \(e\).
      \item[\emph{Then}:]
        \(e\) is not an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:requ-ros}
    Assume \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{}.

    Now, suppose a \ros{} fails to hold between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) in \(e\).

    By \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support}, \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Psi\) is not a \fc{} for \vAgent{}.

    Therefore, by the definition of a \requ{}, the agent is not concluding.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Intuitively, \autoref{prop:requ-ros} states that, whatever \ros{1} amount to in practice, if a \ros{} fails to hold, from an \agpe{}, then no concluding.

  % \ros{} capture distinctive relation between conclusion and \pool{}.
  % \supportII{}, holds without \wit{}.
  % \fc{}, holds.
  % Hence, the proposition.
\end{note}

\section{\requ{3} and \qWhyV{}}
\label{cha:binding:sec:requ-qWhyV}

\begin{note}
  \questionWhyV*

  So, dependence.

  \begin{proposition}[\requ{3} and \qWhyV{}]
    \label{prop:requ-WhyV}

        Events: \(e\), \(e^{\flat}\)
      \item

      \end{itemize*}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \ref{prop:requ-WhyV:if:concludes},~\ref{prop:requ-WhyV:if:concluding}, and~\ref{prop:requ-WhyV:if:requ} hold:

      \item
        \label{prop:requ-WhyV:if:concludes}
        \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \item
        \label{prop:requ-WhyV:if:concluding}
        \(e^{\flat}\) sub-event of \(e\) in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \item
        \label{prop:requ-WhyV:if:requ}
        \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of \(e^{\flat}\)
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume*=propRequWhyVSeries]
      \item
        \label{prop:requ-WhyV:tn:answer}
        \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is, in part, an answer to \qWhyV{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:requ-WhyV}
    Suppose \ref{prop:requ-WhyV:if:concludes},~\ref{prop:requ-WhyV:if:concluding}, and~\ref{prop:requ-WhyV:if:requ} hold.

    Now, suppose a \ros{} fails to hold between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) in \(e^{\flat}\).

    \autoref{prop:requ-ros}, \(e^{\flat}\) is not an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

    Hence, does not develop.

    By assumption, does develop.

    Hence, \ros{} holds.

    This gets us the a condition and conditional.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Key.

  Intuition is that \tR[concluding]{}.
  Therefore, matters whether or not \fc{}.
  Hence, matters whether or not \ros{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  This is not merely some statement about \tR[concluding]{}.

  Intuitively, if \tR[concluding]{} then something about what secures the agent's concluding as \tR[concluding]{0}.

  Stronger.
  \requ{} is such that this is part of what makes the act an act of concluding.

  Put it this way.
  Concern about \tR[concluding]{0}.
  Then, it may still be the agent is concluding.

  With \requ{}, this is not the case.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Before turning to \issueConstraint{}, apply to the pair of \scen{1} which satisfy conditions from \autoref{cha:requs}.

  \scen{1} which satisfy conditions from \autoref{cha:requs}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \autoref{scen:squish}.

    \(\pv{\text{\sqE{} is sound}}{\text{True}}\) from some \pool{} \(\Psi\).
    Where, previous proof of \(\pv{\text{\sqE{} is sound}}{\text{True}}\) from \(\Psi\).
  \item
    \autoref{illu:gist:sudoku}.

    Interactive \scen{0}, in which  repeat reasoning to some partial or full solution to Sudoku puzzle.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \autoref{scen:squish}

  It seems does explain, in part, why.
  For, rehearsing, no \ros{}, no \fc{}, then stop.

  Likewise with Sudoku.
  Not only that you concluded, but that you would repeat.

  At issue is \tC{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In both cases, \wit{}.
  Indeed, \wit{} follows from construction of \illu{1}.
  Motivating idea was of repetition.
  Repetition, requires original event.
  And, original event serves as a \wit{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  It seems, also, that explain why I did not conclude lost keys.
  And, why kettle logic is bad.
\end{note}


\section{\requ{3} and \issueConstraint{}}
\label{cha:binding:sec:requ-iC}

\begin{note}
  With \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV} we observe the way in which \tR{0}, \fc{1}, and \requ{1} may come together to provide counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.

  In short, we need some instance in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) such that \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of the agent concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), yet the agent does not have a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Psi\).

  In full detail:

  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Propositions: \(\phi\), \(\psi\)
      \item
        Values: \(v\), \(v'\)
      \item
        \pool{3}: \(\Phi\), \(\Psi\)
      \item
        Events: \(e\), \(e^{\flat}\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{itemize*}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \ref{prop:requ-WhyVCes:if:concludes},~\ref{prop:requ-WhyVCes:if:concluding},~\ref{prop:requ-WhyVCes:if:requ},~and~\ref{prop:requ-WhyVCes:noW} hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), series=propRequWhyVSeries]
      \item
        \label{prop:requ-WhyVCes:if:concludes}
        \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \item
        \label{prop:requ-WhyVCes:if:concluding}
        \(e^{\flat}\) sub-event of \(e\) in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \item
        \label{prop:requ-WhyVCes:if:requ}
        \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of \(e^{\flat}\)
      \item
        \label{prop:requ-WhyVCes:noW}
        No \wit{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume*=propRequWhyVSeries]
      \item
        \label{prop:requ-WhyVCes:tn:answer}
        \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a counterexample to \issueConstraint{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}
    \ref{prop:requ-WhyVCes:if:concludes},~\ref{prop:requ-WhyVCes:if:concluding},~\ref{prop:requ-WhyVCes:if:requ} parallel the same conditions from \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV}.
    Therefore, by~\autoref{prop:requ-WhyV}, \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) answers, in part, \qWhyV{}.

    However, by~\ref{prop:requ-WhyVCes:noW}, the agent does not have a \wit{}.

    Therefore, answer, in part, to \qWhyV{} such that no \wit{}.
  \end{argument}

  \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces} does not guarantee the existence of counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.
  And, as we were careful not to presuppose counterexamples to \issueConstraint{} when developing \tR{0}, \fc{1}, and \requ{1}, we have no yet seen any explicit counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.

  In \autoref{cha:ces} we will provide examples which satisfy the conditions of \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}.

\section{Interest}
\label{sec:interest}

\begin{note}
  So, established dependence as captured by conditional.

  Does this really capture why the agent concluded?
\end{note}


\subsection{Considerations}
\label{sec:objection}


\paragraph{Factivity}

\begin{note}
  Non-factive explanation.

  No, \requ{1} require that \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) \emph{is} a \fc{}.
  Hence, if \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) answers \qWhyV{} via \requ{}, then there is a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
\end{note}

\paragraph{Subjunctive}

% \subsubsection{Concluding}
% \label{sec:concluding}

% \begin{note}
%   It is not clear the following suggestion holds.
%   \begin{suggestion}
%     If \(e\) is event which may develop, then \(e\) is event in which concluding.

%     {
%       \color{red}
%       This is where the problem is.
%       I don't think this is obvious.

%       We have assumed that if \(e^{sub}\) \emph{is} an event of concluding, then may develop.

%       However, this suggestion is the converse.
%     }
%   \end{suggestion}
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   For, \(e\) is an event in which the agent throws a dart at the centre of the dartboard.
%   However, at the initial stage of \(e\), it is not the case that the agent is sure to throw the dart at the centre of the dartboard.

%   There is a difference between how the event developed, and how the may have developed.

%   So, this idea isn't right in general.

%   Problem.
%   For, if existential account of progressive, then get explain how things came to be simply by focusing on what happened.

%   I do have an answer to this, which is that the role of the \fc{} is what happened.

%   Okay, so hang on.
%   For an agent to be concluding, it does not need to be the case that the event is guaranteed to develop in a way such that things work out.

%   However, it does need to be the case that there is some way things work out.

%   And, the way in which \requ{1} work is that failure means there is no way in which things work out.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   There are ways to approach this:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     Deny the premise.

%     If event in which an agent concludes, it need not be the case that the agent was concluding throughout all the relevant sub-events.

%     Then, no issue is resolved.
%   \item
%     Deny that the event was an event in which the agent concluded.

%     Specifically, narrow the relevant event.
%     For, we have some initial event, which develops in two a larger event, which finishes with an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
%     So long as final sub-event, then the agent concludes.
%     The issue only arises from the apparent link to earlier (sub-)events.
%     But, if otherwise, then motivation to reject these as (sub-)events of an event in which the agent concludes.
%   \item
%     Shift perspective.

%     What it true after the fact need not be true as things are developing.
%     This is \citeauthor{Boylan:2020aa}'s approach.
%   \end{itemize}

%   I am inclined to consider the former.
%   When speak on concluded, just picking out an event.
%   Naturally event to some default event.
%   However, flexible.

%   So, here \citeauthor{Boylan:2020aa} and darts.
%   I was able to, sure, but only after things hand developed so far.

%   Additionally, consider picture.
%   Drew a dog.
%   However, not the case that drawing a dog throughout associated event.
%   Started out as a doodle.

%   Ran 10k.
%   However, started out, plan was to run 5k.
%   Interesting consequence here is that not running 5k.
%   For, supposing extension came about by choice, something changed, and hence no force to finish at 5k.

%   Running 10k includes running 5k.
%   But, in a more basic case, running.
%   Extends to drawing.

%   In the case of concluding, have reasoning.
% \end{note}

\paragraph{\ros{3}}

\begin{note}
  Here's the thing.
  It is somewhat unclear what it is for a \ros{} to hold.

  We haven't clearly captured something from the \agpe{}, so to speak.
  However, there's no good way to do this.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If go solely from \agpe{}, then \agpe{} is mistaken.
  \item
    If go solely from without \agpe{}, then \agpe{} doesn't matter.
  \end{itemize}

  \requ{3} aim to bridge this gap.

  In particular, \ninf{}.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Embedding}
\label{sec:embedding}

\begin{note}
  \ros{}.
  However, know \fc{}, therefore, it need not be the case that \ros{} answers.

  Complex, so separate chapter.
