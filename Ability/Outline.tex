\section{The issue}
\label{sec:issue}

\begin{note}[Main issue, positive resolution, quick argument for negative]
  Our interest is with the following issue:

  \begin{restatable}[Main]{issue}{issueMain}
    \label{issue:Main}
    Are the cases in which an agent may conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from certain premises without witnessing reasoning that concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from those premises?
  \end{restatable}

  The goal is to motivate a positive resolution:

  \begin{restatable}[Main: tick]{issue}{issueMainPositive}
    \label{issue:Main:R:p}
    \emph{There are cases in which} agent may conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from certain premises without witnessing reasoning that concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from those premises.
  \end{restatable}

  This positive resolution is, by my estimation, not straightforward.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[The quick argument]
  At least, the positive resolution is not straightforward without placing some constraints on \emph{which} premises an agent may appeal to when reasoning, and we will motivate the positive resolution without such constraints.

  For, without constraints on which premises an agent may appeal to when reasoning, one may argue as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Any instance of reasoning is some process with start and end points and intermediary steps.
  \item If an agent has concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) by some reasoning, then the reasoning has start points and intermediary steps.
  \item Hence, the agent has concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) by witnessing some reasoning from some start points via some intermediary steps.
  \item In other words, the agent has concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) by witnessing some reasoning from some premises.
  \end{enumerate}

  In short, so long as an agent has concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\), the agent has always witnessed reasoning from some premises.

  \begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item So, either the start points are the premises of interest mentioned in the issue, or the agent has concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from a distinct set of premises.
  \end{enumerate}

  In other words, either the agent has witnessed reasoning from the premises of interest, or the premises of interest (and any reasoning from them) are not required to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[More on the quick argument]
  The quick argument does not directly lead to a negative resolution to the issue.
  Still, the quick argument does suggest that any appeal to premises \emph{without} witnessing reasoning from those premises is redundant.

  Now, perhaps redundancy isn't so bad.
  I only need a single key to ensure I have the option of unlocking a door, but a second key is useful if the first is lost.

  Still, I take it to be the case that redundancy provides leverage for a wide range of arguments motivating a negative resolution in the case of reasoning.

  For, if appeal to some premises is redundant, then any argument that requires witnessing need only observe that a counterargument must find some role for something which is not needed.

  Reasoning is an event, and distinct way of concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) may be useful, it is unclear why the distinct way of concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) is of use when concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from present premises.
  To push the analogy, a second key may have various uses, but the second key is irrelevant in the event of unlocking the door with the first key.
  That the second key is would unlock the door if the first was lost has no role in the event of unlocking the door with the first key.

  From a different perspective, if appeal to certain premises without witnessing reasoning from those premises is redundant, then it seems any positive role given to appeal to those premises may be redistributed to the premises of the reasoning the agent did witness.

  More concretely, even if I were to show that there was some benefit for concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) via unwitnessed reasoning with respect to some particular account of reasoning, it seems at least plausible that the account of reasoning may be reformulated to derive the same benefit from the premises of the reasoning the agent witnessed.

  More generally, it may seem (and I suspect it does seem) intuitive that the issue should be resolved negatively.
  Reasoning just is obtaining a conclusion by witnessing reasoning from premises.
  And, if the quick argument succeeds, then there surely is some way to preserve the intuition.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, part of the task is to show that the quick argument fails.
  Concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from certain premises without witnessing reasoning that concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from those premises has some role.
  Or, rather, that the quick argument is not without cost.
  Perhaps the issue really should be resolved in the negative, but this will require giving up some at least equally (I think) intuitive ideas.

  The result will be motivation for a positive resolution to the issue.
  However, the motivation will be somewhat narrow.
  To escape the tension, the positive resolution need only hold for a restricted pattern of reasoning.
  Still, with the existential motivated, I hope future work may expand the positive resolution to other patterns of reasoning.
  And, while such expansions may still need to argue that concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from unwitnessed reasoning is makes sense with respect to the specific topic at hand, observing that the broad idea of concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from unwitnessed reasoning may not be dismissed without cost may be an option.
\end{note}

\section{Ideas}
\label{sec:ideas-1}

\subsection{Concluding}
\label{sec:outline:concluding}

\begin{note}[Overview]
  Concluding.
  This is the most basic thing.
  Lay out assumptions as clearly as possible.

  Generally speaking, assumption does two things.
  What concluding is, what concluding is not.
  Assumptions will not provide an exhaustive account of what concluding is and what concluding is not, but sufficient for a main goal.

  Indeed, goal is a substantial result on what some instances of what concluding is.
  And, in turn, a substantial result on what concluding, in general, is not.

  And, as concluding instance of reasoning, the previous two points expand to reasoning in general.
\end{note}


\paragraph{Values and propositions}

\begin{note}[Value proposition]
  Reasoning and claims to support focus.
  Briefly introduce a pair of propositions to clarify claim to support and reasoning.

  \begin{restatable}[Claimed support is for a proposition having some value]{assumption}{assuCSVP}
    \label{assu:CSVP}
    When an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\), the agent assigns value \(v\) to the \world{1} described by \(\phi\).
    (Where propositions individuate \world{1} from the perspective of the agent.)
  \end{restatable}

  \autoref{assu:CSVP} fixes terminology.
  To illustrate, when stating the conclusion of the reasoning sketched above we used the proposition that \emph{the area of the rectangle is \(133\text{cm}^{2}\)}.
  The proposition refers to the \world{} in which the area of the rectangle is \(133\text{cm}^{2}\), and speaking a little more precisely, the agent claimed that the proposition has the value `true' --- though it may be the value turns out to be `false'.
  Or, perhaps if the agent was a little unsure about the accuracy of the ruler, that the proposition has the value `likely', `probable', or some quantitative credence.
  And, some other instance of reasoning may have concluded that the proposition has the value `desirable' --- e.g.\ if the agent was searching for a rectangle of some approximate size.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Nothing in particular hangs on the distinction between different values.
    If you prefer, you may expand the proposition (\world{}) to include additional factors, and consider only the values `true' and `false'.
    For example, the proposition that \emph{I desire the bath to be warm} is false, as opposed me assigned the proposition that \emph{the bath is warm} the value `undesirable'.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Core idea is that claim of support is that the \world{} is a certain way.
  Proposition, what the thing is.
  Value, the way it is.

  A handful of instances:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(p\) is assigned the value `true'. \hfill (\emph{p} is true.)
  \item \(p\) is assigned the value `ought to be'. \hfill (\emph{p} ought to be the case.)
  \item \(p\) is assigned the value `desirable'. \hfill (\emph{p} is desirable.)
  \item \(p\) is assigned the value `improbable'. \hfill (\emph{p} is improbable.)
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
In most cases the value will be clear (i.e. that the proposition is true, though sometimes that the proposition is desirable), and so we will talk of claiming support for the proposition.
  A handful of additional examples will be provided when illustrating the next proposition.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Nothing hangs on distinction between values.
  Reduce everything to truth and falsity.
  However, we do not assume this, and if you do not think this is the case either, then I would like to not suggest that the assumptions and arguments to follow concern only those propositions which may be evaluated as true or false.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Culmination of reasoning}

\begin{note}
  Given the positive resolution, concluding.
  Two place relation.
  Premises and conclusion.

  Result of some event.
  No special significance is attached to the term.

  \begin{restatable}[Claiming support is the result of reasoning]{assumption}{assuCSRR}
    \label{assu:CS-culmination-of-R}
    An agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) just when \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is the culmination of reasoning from some premises \(\Phi\).
  \end{restatable}

  \begin{notation}
    Proposition-value-premise pairing, abbreviate \(\langle \phi,v,\Phi \rangle\) .
  \end{notation}

  Just the result of finishing a process.
  No special significance is attached to the term.

  In this respect, positive resolution, reasoning, but premises of reasoning are not the premises from which agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The role of~\autoref{assu:CS-culmination-of-R} is primarily to ensure that claiming support always guarantee the existence of premises and steps.
  With the exception of some broad constraints to be outlined in further assumptions below, we (will) have little to say about the specifics of what the reasoning consists of.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Quick examples]
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(S\) testified that \(p\), so \(p\) is true.
  \item \(p\) would satisfy every member of the group, so \(p\) ought to be the case.
  \item The song is produced by \(S\), so it is desirable that I listen to it.
  \item The device reads \(p\) and is reliable, so \emph{not}-\(p\) is improbable.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Instances of reasoning may culminate in other ways, so we are only interested in a specific type of reasoning.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Claiming support]
  Expand on this below.
  Briefly mention that this falls short of \emph{establishing} \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Understanding `having value \(v\)']
  In a deductive case, if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.
  Means-end reasoning for desire.
  The value is important.
  If it is true that it past 6pm, then it is true the shop is closed.
  Provides value of shop being closed.

  However, if agent desires that it is past 6pm, then it doesn't follow that the agent desires that the shop is closed.
  Question an agent as to why they think their desires conform to truth --- is-ought problem.

  Means-end reasoning.
  It is true that there is cheese at the centre of the maze.
  And, it is desirable that I obtain the cheese at the centre of the maze.
  Further, it is true that I may only obtain the cheese at the centre of the maze by solving the maze.
  Therefore, it is desirable that I solve the maze.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[`Concluding']
  Rather, \(\phi\) \emph{has} value \(v\).

  So, from the perspective of an agent, `I conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\)' and \(\phi\) has value \(v\) are interchangeable.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Tied to premises]
  What does matter is role of premises.
  From some conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\), from others conclude \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Generally]
  Concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \(\phi\) having value \(v\) follows from premises.
  These premises, and therefore \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

  The `follow' or `therefore' may be deductive or non-deductive.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Three distinct options}

\begin{assumption}
  Fix \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\).
  Three distinct options:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
    \(\langle \phi,v,\Phi \rangle\).
  \item
    Conclude \(\phi\) has some value other than \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
    \(\langle \phi,\overline{v},\Phi \rangle\).
  \item
    Fail to conclude whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
    \(\langle \phi,?,\Phi \rangle\).
  \end{enumerate}
  The second may be further distinguished.
  That \(\phi\) has some other value, and some specific value.
  We have no need for such a finer grained distinction.
\end{assumption}


\paragraph{Delicacy}

\begin{note}
  Reasoning that concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) is distinct from reasoning:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., ref=(\Alph*)]
  \item
    \label{CS:delicacy:O}
    Whose conclusion is (merely) \emph{about} \(\phi\) having value \(v\), and does not `require' \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \item
    \label{CS:delicacy:A}
    That concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{assuming} \dots\space --- where `\emph{assuming} \dots\space' is expanded to include some proposition-value pair \(\langle \chi,v \rangle\) such that they agent has \emph{not} concluded \(\langle \chi,v \rangle\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Epistemic operator]
  The statement of \ref{CS:delicacy:O} is loose, but the underlying idea is straightforward.

  we typically express the conclusion of the agent's reasoning which is (merely) about \(\phi\) having value \(v\) with some adjective.
  For example:

  \begin{quote}
    \vAgent{} \(\{ \text{hopes}, \text{imagines}, \text{desires}, \text{thinks}, \dots \}\) \(\phi\) is true.%
    \footnote{
      More generally, has value \(v\).
    }
  \end{quote}
  Each candidate adjective may be read in a way which is compatible with past, present, or future reasoning which concludes \(\phi\) is not true.
  In this sense, the reasoning is (merely) \emph{about} \(\phi\) being true, and does not require \(\phi\) is true.

  However, the relevant adjective may also be read as an evaluation of the relevant situation.
  It may be \(\phi\) \emph{is} hoped for, imagined, desired, thought, and so on.
  In this sense, the reasoning concludes \(\phi\) has some value \(v\), where the value is some value distinct from `true'.

  For the most part, `true' will be the relevant value \(v\) when discussing instances of reasoning.
  And, you may (unless there is clear tension) substitute mention or use of `\(\phi\) having value \(v\)' for `\(\phi\) being true'.
  Still, we do not require that `true' is the unique value of interest, and on occasion we will observe how various different valuations interact with observations made.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Suppositions]
  \ref{CS:delicacy:A} is more straightforward.
  Contrast the instances of reasoning in~\autoref{fig:Rover}.
  \begin{figure}[h!]
    \mbox{}\hfill
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        \label{fig:Rover:CS:1}
        Rover is tired.
      \item
        \label{fig:Rover:CS:2}
        Rover will fall asleep soon.
      \end{enumerate}
      \caption{}
      \label{fig:Rover:CS}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*\('\).,ref=(\arabic*\('\))]
      \item
        \label{fig:Rover:nCS:1}
        \emph{Supposing} Rover is tired.
      \item
        \label{fig:Rover:nCS:2}
        Rover will fall asleep soon.
      \end{enumerate}
      \caption{}
      \label{fig:Rover:nCS}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill\mbox{}
    \caption{Two instance of reasoning}
    \label{fig:Rover}
  \end{figure}

  \ref{fig:Rover:CS} and \ref{fig:Rover:nCS} are distinguishing by whether or not the premise that Rover is tired is a supposition (\ref{fig:Rover:nCS}) or not (\ref{fig:Rover:CS}).

  It may be the case that Rover would fall asleep soon if Rover were tired, but as \ref{fig:Rover:nCS:1} does not concern the actual state of Rover, \ref{fig:Rover:nCS:2} need not concern the actual state of Rover.

  By contrast,~\ref{fig:Rover:CS} is an instance of reasoning about how things are.
  The agent is holding that it is the case that Rover is tired, and therefore it is the case that Rover will fall asleep soon.

  I take this distinction to be straightforward.
  Though, it is not always immediately clear how the distinction applies to some conclusion of reasoning when stated independently of the preceding reasoning.
  Consider the conclusion:

  \begin{quote}
    That Rover is asleep is likely.
  \end{quote}

  Following the distinction, there are two broad ways of interpreting the conclusion:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    The agent has made some plausible assumptions and granting those assumptions, Rover is asleep.
  \item
    For every proposition-value pair \(\chi_{i}\) having value \(v_{i}\) the agent has appealed to, the agent hold it to be the case \(\chi_{i}\) has value \(v_{i}\).
    However, the agent only concludes from \(\chi_{i}\) having values \(v_{i}\) that there is some (objective or subjective) chance that Rover is asleep.
  \end{enumerate}
  So, though claiming support is for some proposition \(\phi\) having some value \(v\), it is not clearly the case that claiming support is restricted to certain proposition-value combinations.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Analogue]
  Analogue of concluding for conditional.
  Here, bundle into \(\phi\).
  More generally, not much need for conditional stuff.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Unique}

\begin{note}[Unique]
  \begin{assumption}[Conclusions are unique]
    \label{assu:conc:unique}
    If an agent has the option of concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\), then the agent does not have the option of concluding \(\langle \phi,\overline{v} \rangle\).
  \end{assumption}
  In other words, there are no cases where an agent may choose between concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) and concluding \(\phi\) has some value other than \(v\).

  This is weaker than voluntarism.
  An agent may choose whether or not to conclude.
  And, may choose to whether to retract some previous conclusion.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Description free}

\begin{note}[Descriptions]
  An important assumption regarding `concluding' is that an agent need not recognise that they have concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\).\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Contrast, for example, \citeauthor{Anscombe:1957aa} on intention action (\citeyear[\S19]{Anscombe:1957aa}) and \citeauthor{Davidson:1963aa} on primary reasons (\citeyear[5]{Davidson:1963aa}).
  }

  Specifically:
  \begin{assumption}[Concluding is `description-free']
    \label{assu:conc:d-free}
    It is not the case that an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only if the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) under some description \emph{d}, where \emph{d} includes ``\(\phi\) has value \(v\)''.
  \end{assumption}

  X, it is true that X has value v, it is not the case that X does not have value v, it is true that it is not the case that X does not have value v, and so on.
  The descriptions are infinite, but do not amount to distinction conclusions.

  Likewise, \(2 + 2 = 4\), also \(4 = 2 + 2\).
  X is taller than Y, Y is shorter than X.

  Now, could say that in concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) an agent concludes that \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) only if \(\phi\) having value \(v\) and \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) are equivalent from the perspective of the agent.

  As observed, there is an intuitive sense in which an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only if the agent recognises that \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  And, a restriction to equivalent proposition-value pairs provides is also intuitive.
  However, we leave~\autoref{assu:conc:d-free} as is.
  While some specifics of argument to follow will rely on~\autoref{assu:conc:d-free} denying the requirement of a description in general, the spirit is independent.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    In particular, if~\autoref{assu:conc:d-free} were rewritten to hold that `it is the case' rather than `it is not the case', our attention would turn to instances in which an agent recognises that \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only if they have the option of concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  }

  Still, it is perhaps important to note that~\autoref{assu:conc:d-free} is motivated only by proposition-value pairs which are equivalent from the perspective of the agent.
  In particular, we not assume a general `closure' condition%
  \footnote{
    Consider by parallel closure of knowledge under known entailment:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If an agent knows that \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only when \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then if the agent knows \(\phi\) has value \(v\), then the agent knows \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
    \end{itemize}
    This closure condition differs in forms, as it concerns knowledge as a state, by may be reformulated to a closer parallel:
        \begin{itemize}
    \item If an agent knows that \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only when \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then in coming to know \(\phi\) has value \(v\) the agent comes to know \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
    \end{itemize}
  }
  of the form:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If an agent has previously concluded that \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only when \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then the agent concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) involves concluding that \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  \end{itemize}

  Though, as we will see, something like a closure principle will follow in certain cases of concluding.
\end{note}

\subparagraph{\indicateN{2}}

\begin{note}
  Strictly speaking, optional.

  We begin with a definition, and then state the assumption with respect to the definition.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{restatable}[\indicateN{2}]{definition}{defIndicate}
    \label{def:indication}
    An instance of reasoning performed by some agent \vAgent{} which concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{\indicateV{1}} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) if and only if:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      It is not \epPAd{}, from \vAgent{}' epistemic state, that \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) while \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\).
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{restatable}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{restatable}[\indicateN{2}]{assumption}{assuIndicate}
    \label{assu:indication}
    If agent has claimed support for some proposition \(\phi\) having value \(v\), then the agent's claimed support extends to any proposition-value pair \indicateVed{} by \(\phi\) having value \(v\).
  \end{restatable}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In other words, \autoref{assu:indication} is a closure condition on claiming support.
  Still, \autoref{assu:indication} is only a closure condition with respect to an agent's epistemic state.
  To illustrate:
  Suppose an agent has concluded that The Scarlet Pimpernel rescued Marquis de Lafayette.
  As `The Scarlet Pimpernel' and `Sir Percy Blakeney' are co-referential, it may be that the agent's conclusion \indicateV{1} that Sir Percy Blakeney' rescued Marquis de Lafayette.
  However, the conclusion will \indicateN{0} \emph{only if} there are no \epPW{1} in which `The Scarlet Pimpernel' and `Sir Percy Blakeney' refer to different individuals.

  Likewise, an agent may conclude that helping The Scarlet Pimpernel is desirable, without the conclusion \indicatePr{} that helping Sir Percy Blakeney is desirable.

  Indeed, an agent's conclusion that it is raining, while standing in Gower Street, may fail to \indicateN{} that it is raining in London if the agent considers it \epPAd{} that they are not in London.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The primary role of \autoref{assu:indication} is to avoid narrowly identifying the conclusion of an instance of reasoning with any particular proposition-value pair.
  So long as the agent holds that a collection of proposition-value pairs are co-extensional with respect to \epPW{1}, then the relevant proposition-value pairs are interchangeable.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Note, however, that the agent may hold that the collection of proposition-value pairs are not co-extensional with respect to \epGW{1}.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  A minor, though useful, consequence of \autoref{assu:indication} is that the following proposition-value pairs all mutually \indicateN{} one another.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \item It is true \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \item It is true that it is true \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \item It is not the case \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\).
  \item And so on\dots
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  Important thing.
  Claimed support and \indicateN{0} are relative to an agent's epistemic state.
  If an agent has claimed support, and this indicates, then the claimed support doesn't necessarily apply given novel information.
  Hence, will also not indicate.
  Indeed, given novel information, did not \indicateN{} \emph{prior} to novel information either.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Universals and existentials]
  Allow that concluding for all\dots is not the same as concluding \dots.

  However, assume that in some cases, these have entailments.
  If for all, and possible to reason, then conclude that would conclude \dots.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Perspective on issue]
  Looking ahead, perspective on issue.
  In some cases, concluding one would conclude \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from some premises \(\Phi\) is equivalent to concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi'\), where \(\Phi\) and \(\Phi'\) are distinct.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Summary}

\begin{note}[Summary]
  Handful of assumptions regarding concluding.

  For the most part, I take these to be straightforward.

  Suspect,~\autoref{assu:conc:d-free} is of interest.
  Again, while there may be a sense of `concluding' for which~\autoref{assu:conc:d-free} does not apply, there is a sense of `concluding' for which~\autoref{assu:conc:d-free} does apply.
  This sense of `concluding'.

  However, I suspect that this does not impact interest.
  For, if recognise conclude in latter sense, then no issue concluding in former sense.
  Still, this is additional argument.
  And, would rather avoid issues regarding phenomenology of concluding.
  Well, do avoid such issues.
\end{note}

\subsection{\csN{2}}
\label{sec:csn2}

\begin{note}[Introduction]
  Following~\autoref{sec:outline:concluding}, our broad interest is with reasoning by some agent that concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) (shorthand: reasoning that concludes \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\)).
  However, with respect to arguing for~\autoref{issue:Main:R:p}, we narrow our attention to when concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) has a particular property.
  We term the property `\csN{}'.

  The sole question for whether an agent \csV{} for \(\phi\) having vale \(v\) when concluding \(\langle \phi, v \rangle\) is:
  \begin{quote}
    Does \(\phi\) having value \(v\) ensure that there is some other proposition-value pair \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) such that (from the agent's perspective) the agent may have concluded that \(\phi\) \emph{does not} have value \(v\) if they were to have first reasoned about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\)?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If there is no such \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\), then the agent \csN{}.
    \item If there is some \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\), then the agent fails to \csN{}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{quote}

  In other words, an agent \csV{} for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) only if \(\phi\) having value \(v\) does not raise the possibility that the agent may have concluded otherwise.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Simple examples of \csN{}]
  Simple examples of \csV{} for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from the testimony of experts as a layperson.
  For, as a layperson one has no way of querying whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Hence, \(\phi\) having value \(v\) does not introduce the possibility of reasoning about some other proposition-value pair and concluding \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\).
  Fermat's last theorem is true, I am told, and I do not have the means to query the proof.

  Other examples involve unique sources of information.
  I conclude from the position of the hands on my watch that it is midday.
  The sky is cloudy, and without a second time piece I have no hope of reaching a different conclusion.

  And, more commonplace examples involve the gradual accumulation of proposition-value pairs.
  \nagent{16} \emph{said} they're coming to the party, but you know from \nagent{17} that \nagent{16} is coming to the party only if \nagent{18} is coming to the party.
  Without further information, reasoning about whether \nagent{18} is coming to the party might prevent you from taking \nagent{16} at the word.
  However, you have already have conformation from \nagent{18} that they are coming to the party.

  Likewise, suppose there are clear skies.
  Then, it is around midday only if the sun is (roughly) at the highest point of the sky.
  Though, I already concluded that the sun is (roughly) at the highest point of the sky prior to checking my watch for a more accurate read of the time.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Simple failures]
  My preferred example for \emph{failure} to claim support is lost keys.
  Tempting as it may be to conclude that a pair of keys are lost after some searching, if the keys really are lost then there aren't in a handful of places you haven't yet thought to look.
  And, until you have concluded that the keys really aren't in those places, and that there is no-where else to look, the keys aren't really lost.

  Likewise, a friend's story may be entertaining, but one doesn't \csN{} that it actually happened without first checking that the details add up.

    \caption{A visualisation of when an agent has \csVed{} for \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).}
    \label{fig:csN:illu:overview}
  \end{figure}

\begin{note}[Figure]
  \autoref{fig:csN:illu:overview} provides a rough visualisation of the constraint~\ref{idea:CS:overview} imposes on an instance of reasoning for the reasoning to be an instance of \csN{}.

  The flat line captures the agent's reasoning, which concludes with \(\langle \phi, v \rangle\).
  In concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) the agent rules out two possibilities with respect to \(\phi\).
  First, that \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\), indicated by \(\langle \phi,\overline{v} \rangle\).
  Second, that the agent does not assign any value to \(v\), indicated by \(\langle \phi,? \rangle\).
  Prior to concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\), the agent's reasoning may have branched to either alternative path, but as the agent has concluded \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\), neither path is viable, and hence both paths are represented with a dashed line.

  So far, we have seen only that the agent has concluded \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).

  With respect to \csN{}, observe that prior to ruling out alternative branches with respect to \(\phi\), the agent may have reasoned about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v\).
  And, from the agent's perspective, \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only if \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  If \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\), then either \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\), or the agent's reasoning would not conclude with a value for \(\phi\), indicated by \(\langle \phi,\{\overline{v},?\} \rangle\).

  Hence, prior to concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\), the agent has concluded \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Following visual]
  Broadly, then, we may say that an agent has \csVed{} for \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) just in case when concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) it is not the case that the agent's reasoning could have branched to a different conclusion with respect to \(\phi\).

  However, the visualisation of~\autoref{fig:csN:illu:overview} and this broad statement of \csN{} are a little too broad.
  For, we are only interested in proposition-value pairs guaranteed by \(\phi\) having value \(v\).
  \csN{} is not global with respect to all proposition-value pairs that the agent may have reasoned about, but local to those guaranteed by the proposition.

  This restriction may seem arbitrary, and to some degree I think it is.
  Ideally, an agent concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) is an instance of \csN{} just in case the agent would not have reasoned to a different conclusion if they were ti reason first about any other proposition-value pair.
  However, the advantage of focusing on some proposition-value pair `required' by \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is a significant constraint on the range of proposition-value pairs an agent needs to consider in order to \csN{}.

  In general, it may not be clear which proposition-value pairs may lead an agent to fail to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\), but so long the proposition-value pair of interest is given by \(\phi\) having value \(v\), an exhaustive search over all other proposition-value pairs may be avoided.

  Indeed, we will say that an agent has \emph{\support{}} for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) just in case they would not have reasoned otherwise, and reserve \emph{\claiming{}} \support{} for the weaker notion.

  We save discussion of \support{} for~\autoref{cha:claiming-support}, which will explore both \support{} and \csN{} in some detail.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\csN{} idea]
  With the general notion of \csN{} in hand, and a few \illu{1} considered, we refine the notion of \csN{} into an idea.

  First, we introduce the help notion of some proposition-value pair being a \requ{} of concluding some (other) proposition-value pair.

  \begin{notion}
    \label{notion:overview:requ}
    \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) is a \requ{} of concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) if:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item From the perspective of the agent, \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only if:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{notion:overview:requ:pool}
        The agent has the option of concluding \(\langle \psi, v' \rangle\) from some pool of premises \(\mathcal{P}\) where:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*., ref=(\roman*), series=csIdeaCounter]
        \item
          \label{notion:overview:requ:pool:incl}
          \(\mathcal{P}\) does not include \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).
        \item
          \label{notion:overview:requ:pool:int}
          \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) would not be needed as an intermediary step of concluding \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\mathcal{P}\).
        \item
          \label{notion:overview:requ:pool:ind}
          For any proposition-value pair \(\langle \chi_{i}, v_{i} \rangle\) in \(\mathcal{P}\), the agent may conclude \(\langle \chi_{i}, v_{i} \rangle\) without concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).
        \end{enumerate}
      \item
        \label{notion:overview:requ:nPsi-nPhi}
        If fail to conclude \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\mathcal{P}\) then would not conclude \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{notion}

  \begin{idea}[\csN{2}]
    \label{idea:CS:overview}
    An agent \csV{} for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) when concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) \emph{only if}:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      \label{idea:CS:overview:requ}
      For any proposition-value pair \(\langle \psi, v' \rangle\) which is a \requ{} of concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) either:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        \label{idea:CS:overview:requ-sat:Past}
        The agent has concluded that they would conclude \(\langle \psi, v' \rangle\) from the relevant pool of premises \(\mathcal{P}\).
      \item
        \label{idea:CS:overview:requ-sat:Pres}
        In concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) the agent (also) concludes that they would conclude \(\langle \psi, v' \rangle\) from the relevant pool of premises \(\mathcal{P}\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{idea}

  \autoref{idea:CS:overview} states that any \requ{} of concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) has been satisfied in one of two ways.

  First:
  The agent having concluded that they would conclude \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from the relevant pool of premises prior to concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).

  Second:
  The agent simultaneously concluding that they would conclude \(\langle \psi, v' \rangle\) from the relevant pool of premises \(\mathcal{P}\) while concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).

  Observe, neither option (immediately, at least) requires the agent concludes \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from the relevant pool of premises.
  What~\autoref{idea:CS:overview} states is weaker, concerning only whether or not they (the agent) would conclude \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from the relevant pool of premises.

  For example, counterexample for some formula of propositional logic.
  Constructed a truth table.
  Identified a line.
  If counterexample, then line makes any tautology of propositional logic true.
  And, do not need to appeal to the line being a counterexample to the relevant formula to do so.
  However, do not need to reason from line to any recognised tautology.
  Conclude that if were to reason, tautology would be true.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Though, it is also plausible that conclude the provides a model, and in doing so conclude that all tautologies hold.
    Any particular tautology need not be a distinct conclusion.
    Recall~\autoref{assu:conc:d-free}.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Still, the second option may be of some concern.
  Note, however, this is only an option.
  If you go for negative resolution, then ruled out, but then first option alone.
  However, this is not obviously required.

  Propositional logic.
  These premises allow to conclude two things.
  Then, conclusion that \(\phi \land \psi\) is simultaneously a conclusion that \(\phi\) and that \(\psi\).

  Or, apples in a bag.
  Five.
  Well, could do at least four, three, etc.
  Conclude at the same time.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\requ{1}]
  Now, the primary feature of \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) being a \requ{} of concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) is the option of concluding \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from some pool of premises.
  However, the majority of the content of \label{idea:CS:overview:requ} concerns the relationship between \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) and the pool of premises.
  In short, \autoref{notion:overview:requ:pool:incl},~\autoref{notion:overview:requ:pool:int}, and~\autoref{notion:overview:requ:pool:ind} combine to ensure that the agent has the option of concluding \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) independently of whether they have concluded \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).
\end{note}


\begin{note}[Expanding pool constraints]
  To~\autoref{notion:overview:requ:pool} of~\autoref{notion:overview:requ} the following clause may also be added:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=]
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}[label=]
    \item
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*., ref=(\roman*), resume*=csIdeaCounter]
        \setcounter{enumiii}{3}
      \item
        \label{notion:overview:requ:pool:method}
        Concluding \(\langle  \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\mathcal{P}\) involves the same general method the agent would use to conclude \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  We omit~\autoref{notion:overview:requ:pool:method} from the idea of \csN{} for two (related) reasons.
  First, it is not clear what `the same general method' amounts to in details.
  Second, avoiding questions about method affords flexibility when providing \illu{1} of \csN{}.
  However,~\autoref{notion:overview:requ:pool:method} may be imposed with no loss to the role of \csN{} in the overall argument.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\requ{3}]
  So,~\autoref{idea:CS:overview}, no unsatisfied \requ{1}.

  Keys.
  Lost keys, but until I've checked everywhere, might find them.
  So, conclude lost, then not in coat pocket.
  Well, not going to conclude lost at least until I've checked the pocket.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Importance of \csN{}]
  \csN{} is key.
  Argument for positive resolution to~\autoref{issue:Main} largely rests on \csN{}.
  Our immediate goal is to motivate interest in \csN{}.

  However, briefly note that a few things.

  First, agent's reasoning.
  At issue is whether the agent may reason to a different conclusion.
  There's nothing that would lead me elsewhere.

  Second, agent's reasoning.
  Independent of whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\), \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), or any of the premises.
  Need not be the case that satisfaction amounts to anything substantial.
  No clause for justification, etc.

  Third, way.
  Getting \(\langle \phi, v \rangle\) from premises.
  Inclined to think that \csN{} is more general.
  From \(\langle \phi, v \rangle\).
  However, some concerns.
  See this after.

  Fourth, `would'.
  Competence, rather than performance.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Building to \illu{1}]
  Consider a handful of cases.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Trivial]
  No independent checks.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Pruning]
  NTP server.
  Not from clock, but from NTP.
  Here, no way to check this.
\end{note}


\begin{note}[Keys case]
  Without \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) is important.
  Keys.
  In hand.
  Well, then conclude not in drawer, which haven't yet looked.

  There are two options.
  First, \requ{}.
  Hence, conclude that if look in drawer then would not find.
  This seems plausible.

  Second, not a \requ{}.
  Indeed, despite intuitiveness of first option, it is the second that is the case.
  \autoref{notion:overview:requ:nPsi-nPhi} is important.
  If looked in drawer and found a pair of keys.
  Well, this would not prevent you from concluding you're found your keys.
  Rather, confusion over a having a pair of keys.
  This would not show a mistake in reasoning, but rather a mistake your understanding of how things are.
  And, revised, there is no telling what conclusions you may reach.

  Now, there may be some analogue to \csN{} which entertains revised information.
  Indeed, conditional belief.
  However, \csN{} is about reasoning.

  The original keys example, then, is limited to reasoning about a possible location.
  If location, then would not clearly conclude lost.
  At issue was not finding and then concluding not lost.

  In this respect, reasoning after finding keys is significantly different.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\illu{3}]
  Begin with a collection of \illu{1} with respect to a simple instance of reasoning: concluding it is midday from the positions of the hands on a clock.


  For example, with clocks.

  No option.
  One authoritative timepiece.

  Also, testimony that some mathematical theorem is true.

  No distinct premises.
  Reason from position of hands on clock to conclude that it is midday.
  All other clocks are kept in sync via an NTP time server, so no independent check.

  Also, two calculators.
  Same internals.

  Multiple checks.
  Two clocks.
  Wristwatch and clock on the library wall.

  Also, milk.
  Safe to drink from sell by date.
  Smell if it's off.

  Coming to the party.
  Well, then decided not to go to the beach.
  So, check this before.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Finally, ability.
  Ability enters indirectly.
  First, certain cases of reasoning.
  These, then, have some generality.
  Concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) involves general reasoning.
  Chess, sudoku, etc.
  It's no accident.
  Still, \csVed{}.

  Difficulty.
  Independent check.
  Would not conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) if were to fail to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  Some problem in the general reasoning.

  Now, applying previous observation.
  Either \csVed{} or witness.
  In these cases, no witnessing.
  So, \csVed{}.

  However, always a check on whether one has the general ability.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Reasoning, \support{}, would not reason to a different conclusion.

  Specifically, \requ{} of some conclusion.
  So long as conclusion, then it is possible to reason about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), and unless conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), would not conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

  Intuitively, \requ{} as an independent check on the reasoning.
  If don't hold \(\psi\) from premises, then question about whether \(\phi\).

  Claiming support, necessary condition is satisfying all \requ{1}.
  Claiming support, then, is weaker than having support.
  Restricted to whether conclusion of reasoning would introduce a \requ{}.
  And, may be further restricted without impact to the tension we will develop to whether the conclusion would `clearly' introduce a \requ{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Now, consequence from \ideaCS{} and \ESU{},
  If potential witnessing event, then either concluded previously, or witness reasoning.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Kettle logic]
  Well, it's true that the person must be acquitted, but at the same time, the person is going to have a hard time explaining how, for example, he brewed coffee for a week.

  Still, highlights what the neighbour needs to conclude.
  Did borrow.
  Was not lent damaged
  And, was returned damaged.

  Here, burden of argument.
  However, we're not interested in whether the neighbour would convince, but whether the neighbour would reach a different conclusion if they were first to reason about one of the three before concluding that the kettle was returned damaged.
\end{note}

\subsection{`Use'}
\label{sec:issue-refined}

\begin{note}
  Clarified concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  And, broad idea of \csN{0}.
  Briefly restate main issue.

  We're just looking for an existential.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{restatable}[\ESU{0} --- \ESU{}]{target}{targetESU}
    \label{denied-claim}
    An agent concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) is an instance of claiming support \emph{only if}:

    For any pool of proposition-value pairs \(\langle \chi_{1},v_{1} \rangle,\dots,\langle \chi_{k},v_{k} \rangle\) appealed to as premises, the agent has witnessed reasoning which concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\chi_{i}\) having values \(v_{i}\).\nolinebreak
    \footnote{More generally, the agent has witnessed reasoning whose conclusion \emph{indicates} \(\phi\) has value \(v\).}
  \end{restatable}


  Some instance of reasoning from premises which indicates conclusion.
  Reasoning is compatible with the agent claiming support for the conclusion only if some agent has witnessed the reasoning.

  Necessary condition on claiming support.
  Key point is that, whether or not there are genuine cases of claiming support, \autoref{denied-claim} provides a clear condition for rejecting the possibility that some instance of reasoning is an instance of claiming support.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Important that \ESU{} is fairly weak.

  Has witnessed reasoning.

  Indeed, \ESU{} may be weakened further, \emph{some} agent.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Simple example, know that some logic is decidable.
    Take a relatively simple fragment.
    Then, either proof or a countermodel.
    Same idea holds for tension, but there's no guarantee that anyone has concluded\dots
  }
  However, to keep things straightforward, focus on a single agent.
  Indeed, the tension arises from focus on the agent's own reasoning.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{restatable}[\EAS{0} --- \EAS{}]{goal}{goalEAS}
    \label{prop:EAS}
    There are instances of reasoning in which an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) by appeal to some pool of proposition-value pairs \(\langle \chi_{1},v_{1} \rangle,\dots,\langle \chi_{k},v_{k} \rangle\) as premises without witnessing reasoning from \(\langle \chi_{1},v_{1} \rangle,\dots,\langle \chi_{k},v_{k} \rangle\) to \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).

    And, on some occasions, the reasoning is an instance of claiming support.
  \end{restatable}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The distinction here is whether some instance of reasoning needs to be witnessed in order for the reasoning to be compatible with the agent claiming support.

  \EAS{} contains two existentials.
  Some instances of reasoning, and some of these are instances of claiming support.
  Of course, interest is with the intersection.
  Instances of reasoning which are instances of claiming support.

  Key is ability.
  Specifically, ability to reason.
  This provides information to the agent.
  Given premises, then conclusion.
  Ability, in these cases, functions as an `interpolant'.

  Expand after outlining argument.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  While \EAS{} is our `goal', the argument will be indirect.
  Motivate \EAS{} by observing that tension follows from combining \USE{} with two additional ideas.

      \item
        It is possible for \vAgent{} to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) by witnessing reasoning from \(\langle \chi_{1},v_{1} \rangle,\dots,\langle \chi_{k},v_{k} \rangle\) to \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).

\section{Tension}
\label{sec:tension}

\begin{note}[Intro]
  Seen \csN{} and \ESU{}.
  Task is now to develop tension.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Basic idea of tension]
  The basic idea is relatively straightforward.
  Identify some abstract phenomenon.
  Observe possible tension.
  Motivate instances of this phenomenon.
  Observe tension.
  Resolve tension by rejecting \ESU{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Goal]
  To establish tension between \ESU{} and \csN{} we have the following goal:

  \begin{goal}
    \label{goal:tension}
    There are instances in which concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi\) seems to be an instance of \csN{} for \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) where:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=\named{G\ref{goal:tension}:\arabic*}]
    \item
      \label{goal:tension:requ}
      There is some \(\langle \psi,v',\Psi \rangle\) which is a \requ{} of \(\langle \phi,v,\Phi \rangle\) such that:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=\named{G\ref{goal:tension}:1\alph*}]
      \item
        \label{goal:tension:requ:conclude}
        It is not possible for the agent to conclude that they would conclude \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\Psi\) \emph{without} concluding \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\Psi\).
      \item
        \label{goal:tension:requ:no-reason}
        The agent does not witness any reasoning from premises \(\Psi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{goal}

  If there are instance of the type described by \autoref{goal:tension}, then \ESU{} and \csN{} are in tension.

  For, we will have some proposition-value-premise pairing \(\langle \phi,v,\Phi \rangle\) such that an agent conclude \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi\), and in doing so \csV{} for \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\).
  And, by \autoref{goal:tension:requ} we have some \requ{} \(\langle \psi,v',\Psi \rangle\).

  Now, as \(\langle \psi,v',\Psi \rangle\) is a \requ{0} of concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi\), it must be the case that the agent either has concluded or simultaneously concludes that they would conclude \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\Psi\) when concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi\).

  Further, the \requ{} \(\langle \psi,v',\Psi \rangle\) has two key properties.

  First, from~\autoref{goal:tension:requ:conclude}, the agent may only conclude that they would conclude \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\Psi\) by concluding \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\Psi\).
  Hence, by \ESU{} it must be the case that the agent witnesses reasoning from \(\Psi\) which concludes with \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\).

  Second, from~\autoref{goal:tension:requ:no-reason} the agent does not witness any reasoning from \(\Psi\).
  Hence, the agent does not witness reasoning from \(\Psi\) which concludes with \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\).

  From the above, tension.
  For, if concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi\) really is an instance of \csN{}, then the agent must have concluded \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\Psi\) without witnessing reasoning from \(\Psi\) to \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\).
  However, if \ESU{} holds then it is not possible for the agent to conclude \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\Psi\) without witnessing reasoning from \(\Psi\) to \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\).
  So, either the agent has not \csN{} for \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) or \ESU{} does not hold.
  Hence, either \csN{} or \ESU{} must be restricted in some way.

  Of course, the exact nature of the tension, and how it should be resolved, depends in part on the proposition-value-premise pairings which satisfy \autoref{goal:tension}.

  Indeed,~\autoref{goal:tension:requ:conclude} and~\autoref{goal:tension:requ:no-reason} are significant restrictions, and it is not clear from the abstract statement that these correspond to sufficiently interesting phenomenon.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Whether or not~\autoref{goal:tension:requ:no-reason} is satisfied will depend on the specifics of any given instance.
  For, we have placed no constraints on which premises an agent appeals to, nor what the contents of those premises may be.

  \autoref{goal:tension:requ:conclude}, by contrast, will follows from a collection of \requ{1} forming a `\cluster{}'.

  In short, a \cluster{} is a collection of proposition-value-premise pairings such that every proposition-value-premise pairing is a \requ{} of every other proposition-value-premise pairing in the collection.

  Intuitively, every proposition-value-premise pairing of the \cluster{0} is an independent check on every other proposition-value-premise pairing of the \cluster{0}.

  Indeed, we will argue that \autoref{goal:tension:requ:conclude} is satisfied whenever \(\langle \phi,v,\Phi \rangle\) is a member of a \cluster{}.

  Finally, then, we seek some concrete instances.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Ability]
  Here, our interest turns to ability.
  I take it as given that there are various instances of concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi\) for which the reasoning from \(\Phi\) to \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) is an instance of a general ability.

  For example, I conclude \(31 + 53 = 84\) from some premises, and the reasoning falls under my general ability to perform (simple) arithmetic.
  The specifics may differ, but there is sufficient overlap with concluding \(43 + 81 = 123\) and \(91 + 54 = 145\) to consider the reasoning of the same type.
  Indeed, \(532 - 91 = 441\), \(19 * 32 = 608\), and \(126/36 = 3.5\) may also fall under the same (general) ability.
  In other words, in concluding each equation I witness a specific instance of the general ability.

  Likewise, one may have the (general) ability to solve chess problems, complete \(\{ \text{Sudoku}, \text{KenKen}, \text{Nonogram}, \dots\}\) puzzles, or parse sentences in a given language.

  So long as you have the (general) ability, I expect each instance of witness the ability is intuitively an instance of \csN{}.
  I would not have concluded \(31 + 53 \ne 84\) and you would not have failed to identify the relevant winning strategy of some chess problem.

  However, in each of the examples of ability noted, every other specific instance of the general ability functions as an independent check on whether one has the relevant ability.
  I should make no mistake about \(85 + 21\) and you should make no mistake with the next chess problem.
  Granting, of course, that we do have the relevant abilities.

  Hence, it seems clear that if an agent \csV{} for \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) when concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi\) and the agent's reasoning is a specific instance of a general ability, then there at least various \requ{1} associated with concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi\).

  More generally, concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Phi\) from reasoning which is the specific instance of a general ability leads to a \cluster{}.
  And, it is perhaps already intuitive that one does not witness reasoning from the premises of at least some proposition-value-premise pairing in the \cluster{}.

  For example, it seems plausible that the configuration the chess board for any given problem forms of a premise of the agent's reasoning, but so long as one has not seen the relevant problem, it seems implausible that one has witnessed reasoning that includes the relevant configuration.

  Of course, it may seem equally implausible that an agent concludes there is some winning strategy for some configuration of a chess board they have not yet seen.
  However, this intuition should be carefully examined.

  With an unopened chess book by a reputable author before you, I expect you have no problem concluding that each of the solutions are correct.
  {
    \color{red}
    Or, that granting ability, conclude you would (also) conclude winning strategy or not for each chess piece.
  }
  Yet, you have not yet seen any of the solutions.
  So, in general, there seems no issue with an agent concluding there is some winning strategy for some configuration of a chess board they have not yet seen.

  Of course, in the case of the book there is a key premise:
  The book is written by a reputable author.
  However, if you wish to conclude there is a winning strategy via your own reasoning, then the above considerations take effect.%
  \footnote{
    And, indeed, may already hold with respect to the key premises.
    For, so long as you hold you have the general ability to reason about chess problems of the relevant kind, you have an independent check on whether the author really is reputable.
  }

\subsection{\cluster{3} of \requ{1}}
\label{sec:cluster3}

\begin{note}[Main idea]
  A \cluster{0} is a collection of proposition-value-premise pairings such that every proposition-value-premise pairing is a \requ{} of every other proposition-value-premise pairing in the collection.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\requCluster{3}]
  \begin{definition}[A \requCluster{1}]
    \label{def:requCluster}
    Some collection of proposition-value-premise pairings \(\mathcal{C} = \{\langle \phi_{i}, v_{i}, \Phi_{i} \rangle\}_{i}\) is a \emph{\cluster{}} just in case:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      For any \(\langle \phi_{i}, v_{i}, \Phi_{i} \rangle\) in \(\mathcal{C}\), each \(\langle \phi_{j}, v_{j}, \Phi_{j} \rangle\) in \(\mathcal{C}\) (such that \(j \ne i\)) is a \requ{} of \(\langle \phi_{i}, v_{i}, \Phi_{i} \rangle\).
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  Key link:

  \begin{proposition}[\cluster{3} and \csN{0}]
    \label{prop:cluster:csN}
    Suppose we have some \cluster{0} \(\mathcal{C}\).
    Consider some proposition-value-premise pairing \(\langle \phi,v,\Phi \rangle\) in \(\mathcal{C}\).
    Now, for concluding \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) from \(\Sigma\) to be an instance of \csN{}, need to have had concluded, or to simultaneously conclude, that would conclude \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\) from \(\Psi\) for any \(\langle \psi,v',\Psi \rangle\) in \(\mathcal{C}\).
  \end{proposition}

  \autoref{prop:cluster:csN} follows from~\autoref{idea:CS:overview} and~\autoref{def:requCluster}.

  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:cluster:simul}
    Need to do everything in a cluster at the same time.
    \begin{proof}
      Straightforward.
      For, anything is a \requ{} for any other.
      So, only \csV{} at the same time.
    \end{proof}
  \end{proposition}
\end{note}

\begin{note}[No \(\gamma\)]
  Consequence:

  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:cluster:no-general}
    No general \(\langle \gamma,v,\Gamma \rangle\).
    \begin{proof}
      Quickly, because of~\ref{prop:cluster:simul}.
      Only \(\gamma\) at same time as others.

      In more detail.
      For, by assumption, \requ{} means that it's possible for the agent to conclude.
      By the each other \requ{} functions as a check on \(\gamma\).
      If haven't figured out each individual, then the general is in question.
    \end{proof}
  \end{proposition}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \autoref{prop:cluster:simul} is kind of wild.
  Though, this doesn't prevent reasoning, and then only getting \csN{} after the fact.
  However, this does prevent ruling out conflict when concluding.

  Of course, concluding each and then \csVImp{}, plausible.
  As, have not found an issue.

  Also, may conclude all from premises.
  For, special cases of \cluster{} in which all premises are the same.
  If so, then no clear tension.
  For, agent reasons from premises, well all the same premises.
  So, conclude simultaneously.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Indeed, narrow interest to \ragCluster{1}.

  \begin{definition}[\ragCluster{3}]
    Let \(\mathcal{C}\) is a cluster.
    Then \emph{\ragCluster{}} just in case
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There is some \(\langle \phi_{i},v_{i},\Sigma_{i} \rangle\) and \(\langle \phi_{j},v_{j},\Sigma_{j} \rangle\) such that \(\Sigma_{i}\) and \(\Sigma_{j}\) do not overlap.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{definition}

  A \ragCluster{}, then, is just a cluster where at least some distinct premises.
  Hence, avoid issue where same premises allow simultaneous conclusion, and fail to establish tension with \ESU{}.

  \begin{proposition}
    With \ragCluster{} concluded previous or violate \ESU{}.
  \end{proposition}

  Now, some caution.
  It may be the case that reason from some non-minimal collection of premises.
  Hence, some care when establishing \ragged{}.
  This means, argue that \cluster{} \emph{and} argue \cluster{} is \ragged{}.
  Again, without any clear bounds on premises, this argument is non-deductive.
  However, plausible in various cases.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\jag{2}]
  Given importance of \ragged{} and specific proposition-value-premise pairings of \ragged{}, terminology:

  \begin{definition}[\jag{3} of a \ragCluster{}]
    \(\mathcal{C}\) some \ragCluster{}.
    Suppose \(\langle \phi,v,\Phi \rangle\) main.
    \(\langle \psi,v',\Psi \rangle\) is a \emph{\jag{0}} if \(\Psi\) differs from \(\Phi\).
  \end{definition}

  \csN{} while presence of some \jag{} when premises are no general.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Suppose \ragged{}, no prior conclusion for some \jag{}.
  Then, if \csN{}, violation of \ESU{}.

  For, only \csN{} simultaneously.
  \jag{}, some not from current premises.
  And, no previous, so not from previous premises.
  Hence, \csN{} from premises of the \jag{}.

  Hence, need instances of \ragged{} with no prior conclusion for some \jag{}.
\end{note}


\subsection{Ability}
\label{sec:overview:ability}

\begin{note}[Ability]
  Ability to reason in certain ways leads to \cluster{1}.
  However, not interested in ability in general, but rather relatively simple instances of ability concerning specific problem types.

  Arithmetic.
  Sudoku.
  Chess.

  Indeed, the latter pair for \requCluster{1}.
  For, different starting positions.
  
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Finally, ability.

  General ability, specific ability.

  Claim support for having some general ability.

  Now, here, simple cases.
  Basic arithmetic.
  Sudoku puzzles.
  Chess problems with winning strategies.

  Roughly the same.
  More broadly:

  Logic problems.

  Crossword.

  Reading novels up to a certain level.
  Here, if you can't read, then the writing is bad.

  Fluency.

  So, specific instances of the general ability.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Well, conclude that you have the general ability, but also claim support.
  You don't need to go through specific instances.
  In these cases, fail to be an independent check.
  You not fail to reach the relevant conclusion.

  Would not reason to some incorrect summation.
  Would not fill out the Sudoku incorrectly.
  Would not fail to find a winning strategy.

  Of course, failures of performance, but not failures of competence.

  Intuitively, satisfied all \requ{1}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Key argument, then, is that only satisfy a \requ{} by concluding \(\psi\) from \(\rho\).

  For, some other premise, get \(\psi\) from \(\rho\).
  Well, getting \(\psi\) from \(\rho\) is still a \requ{} for this.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Briefly stated.

  Specific instances, these introduce \requ{}.
  However, some reasoning.
  Can't jump to general to get rid of \requ{}, as this is forbidden.
  Further, if reason from some distinct set of premises, then still a \requ{}.

  If independent reasoning gets that specific instance of general ability, then doing the reasoning is still an independent check on this.

  So, the problem here is that need to ensure that would conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from certain premises.
  If appeal to any distinct premises, then failure to claim support.

  Hence, \ESU{} and \ideaCS{}, then no getting general ability without witnessing reasoning for specific instances.

  Core of the tension.
  Always some independent check with distinct premises with specific instance of general ability.

  So, either, allow to bypass independent check.
  Or, do not require witnessing reasoning from premises to conclusion.
\end{note}

\subsection{Tension}
\label{sec:overview:tension:subsection}



\subsection{Resolving the tension}
\label{sec:overview:resolving-tension}

\begin{note}
  Now, possible to resolve tension various ways.
  Reject \ideaCS{}.
  Reject \ESU{}.
  Reject claiming support for general ability.
  Or, any combination of the above.

  Interest is in rejecting \ESU{}.
  So long as \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) follows from some premises, then the reasoning doesn't matter.
  Claim support for \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) from those premises, given the possibility of reasoning.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Note, the tension is not about whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Instead, the tension is about whether the agent would have a certain property if they were to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Property of having claimed \support{}.
  Expanded, property of holding that any independent check is satisfied.
  Any other reasoning about whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\) would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Returning to \EAS{}.
  Specific instances of the general ability.
  In this sense, the instances of \EAS{} we argue for are narrow.
  Need strong sign that the agent has the general ability.

  Further.
  It does not state that an agent having claimed support that they have the ability to reason to some conclusion is \emph{always permissible} to claim support for the conclusion by appealing to some premises that do not form part of the agent's reasoning.
  Instead, it states that \emph{may be permissible} for the agent claim support in a certain way.

  In various respects, these aren't particularly interesting cases.
  However, the goal is to argue that such cases exist.
  Whether these are constrained to the type of cases we consider for the argument is a further question.

  There may be more interesting cases, but given that \ESU{} is incompatible with all such cases, I see no compelling reason to explore such cases without \emph{first} motivating a rejection of \ESU{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Also suggests that the content of general ability is somewhat interesting.
  For, the content is itself general.
  It is a conclusion that ranges over all specific instances of the general ability.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Terminology]
  So, the upshot of this is that an agent concludes various things in certain cases.
  In concluding \(\phi\), also conclude \(\psi,\dots\).
  And, in cases of interest, because of generality of the reasoning.

  This is somewhat puzzling.
  Though, I think less puzzling than first appears.
  Concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) is nothing special.
  Of course, the agent only explicitly concludes a handful of things, but allowing the generality is nothing that different from equivalences.

  It also doesn't follow that any of the additional properties of the reasoning, if any, are carried over to any \requ{1}.
  Is just about concluding.
  Here, then, various ways to keep the intuition for the negative resolution.
  There may be various things that are exclusive to witnessing reasoning from premises to conclusion.
  However, distinct from concluding.

  Still, stronger than being committed.
  Ranges over any implication.
  Conclude no winning strategy, then also conclude various other chess things.
  However, committed, but do not necessarily conclude that X is going to lose the game.

  Concluding is still of interest.
  Or, as noted, `reason', in the weak term.
\end{note}

\subsection{Observations}
\label{sec:overview:observations}

\begin{note}[Conditionals, a point of interest]
  More generally, we have the following result.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    So long as we do not add~\autoref{notion:overview:requ:pool:method} to~\autoref{notion:overview:requ:pool} of the notion of a \requ{}.
    If so, then result will be constrained accordingly.
  }
  If appeal to some conditional which links premises to a conclusion, such that agent may reason from premises to conclusion, then the agent has always concluded premises from conclusion.

  This is interesting.
  If agent has concluded from conditional in this way, then in effect the conditional drops out as a premise.

  If \(\Sigma, \phi \rightarrow \psi \vdash \psi\) then \(\Sigma, \phi \vdash \psi\).

  If \(\Sigma, \phi \vdash \phi \rightarrow \psi\) then \(\Sigma, \phi \vdash \psi\).

  The second is close to a restricted form of the deduction theorem.

  Note, this is only when the conditional has a special \requ{}.

  In cases where no checking the conditional, then the elimination does not hold.

  Whether anything of independent interest follows from this, unclear.
  One example, responsibility.
  Then, to another person, not only reasoning with conditional, but also full reasoning.
  No way to distinguish between the two cases.
  Or, from the converse perspective, no need to add any additional clauses to account of responsibility.
  However, issues of this kind are far beyond the scope of this document.
