\begin{note}
  \begin{quote}
    ``Plenty of blank leaves, I see!'' the Tortoise cheerily remarked.
    ``We shall need them \emph{all}!''
    (Achilles shuddered.)
    ``Now write as I dictate:---

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\emph{\Alph*})]
    \item Things that arc equal to the same are equal to each other.
    \item The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the same.
    \item If \emph{A} and \emph{B} are true, \emph{Z} must be true.
      \setcounter{enumi}{25}
    \item The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other.''
    \end{enumerate}

    ``You should call it \emph{D}, not \emph{Z},'' said Achilles.
    ``It comes \emph{next} to the other three.
    If you accept \emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C}, you \emph{must} accept Z.''

    ``And why \emph{must} I?''

    ``Because it follows \emph{logically} from them.
    If A and B and C are true, Z \emph{must} be true.
    You don't dispute \emph{that}, I imagine?''

    ``If \emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C} are true, \emph{Z} \emph{must} be true,'' the Tortoise thoughtfully repeated.
    ``That's \emph{another} Hypothetical, isn't it?
    And, if I failed to see its truth, I might accept \emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C}, and \emph{still} not accept \emph{Z}, mightn't I ?''

    \mbox{}\hfill\(\vdots\)\hfill\mbox{}

    ``Then Logic would take you by the throat, and force you to do it!''
    Achilles triumphantly replied. ``Logic would tell you 'You ca'n't help yourself.
    \dots''\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\Citeyear[279--280]{Carroll:1895uj})}
  \end{quote}
  Achilles seems to be arguing that accepting \emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C} would be sufficient.
  Tortoise denying that \emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C} are sufficient.
  In particular, possible to accept \emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C} without accepting \emph{Z}.

  Achilles is not citing a causal relation between [\emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C}] and \emph{Z} (or, rather, \emph{D}).
  However, Achilles does seem to be citing a causal relation between accepting [\emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C}] and accepting \emph{Z}.

  The Tortoise would violate some causal law.
  However, despair sets in as Achilles observes that the Tortoise is violating the proposed causal law, and hence it is no law at all.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Though the Tortoise has accepted \emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C}, the Tortoise has not \emph{taken} \emph{A} and \emph{B} and \emph{C} to support \emph{Z}.

  For \citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa}, The Taking Condition expands on a causal process.

\subsection{\EAS{0} --- \EAS{}}
\label{sec:eas}

\begin{note}
  Briefly stated,
  \AR{} understands ability in terms of some (complex) property.
  \WR{} understands ability in terms of possible witnessing events.

  For example, \AR{} may involve the property (attribution) of understanding geometry, perhaps broken down into the understanding or availability of various definitions, propositions, lemmas, theorems, and steps of reasoning.
  While, \WR{} would involve reasoning with particular definitions, propositions, lemmas, theorems, and steps of reasoning.

  So, agent appeals to property, or the reasoning itself.

  The purpose of this distinction is to ensure that our argument against \ESU{} does not rest on a particular way of understanding ability that may not extend to other ways of understanding ability.

  Conjecture that these are fundamentally connected.
  Witnessing event only if understanding.
  And, understanding only if possible to witness reasoning.

  Still, difference.
  Relevant properties are properties of the agent as they are.
  The witnessing event, by contrast, is a possible event.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Property of there being a possible event involving the agent.
    In this case, still distinct from \WR{} as that the agent is part of possible event is still distinct from the reasoning that the agent would witness in the relevant event.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Now turn to the kind of reasoning involved.

  Motivated \AR{} in terms of understanding of premises and steps of reasoning, and \WR{} in terms of a possible event in which agent reasons with particular premises and steps.

  However, a further distinction in terms of what appeal to the relevant premises and steps or instance of reasoning amounts to.

  First, there is the \emph{existence} of premises and steps, or the \emph{possibility} of the witnessing event.
  Second, there is the premises and steps themselves, or the witnessing event.

  Difference from perspective of step of reasoning.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Ability and dispositions}

\begin{note}[Parallel]
  To further clarify the motivation for \EAS{} we introduce a parallel between abilities and dispositions.
  The primary function of the parallel will be to highlight the importance of reasoning about an event.
  In the case of dispositions the event is the manifestation of the disposition, and in the case of ability the event is the agent witnessing the ability.

  The parallel is of interest because \EAS{} concerns the premises and steps of reasoning that the agent would use to witness the relevant ability.
  We will suggest that claiming support that some object has some disposition and that some agent has some ability may both be understood in terms of claiming support that the relevant event is a possible event.

  In turn, if reasoning \emph{to} a specific ability is understood in terms of claiming support that it is possible for the agent to witness the event, then reasoning \emph{from} a specific ability may be understood in terms of claiming support from what would happen in the possible event.
  \end{note}

\begin{note}[Parallel between dispositions and ability]
  Consider \citeauthor{Choi:2021wg}'s characterisation of the Simple Conditional Analysis of dispositions:
  \begin{quote}
    An object is disposed to \emph{M} when \emph{C} iff it would \emph{M} if it were the case that \emph{C}.\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\Citeyear{Choi:2021wg})}
  \end{quote}
  For example, an object is disposed to dissolve when it is placed in water iff the object would dissolve if it were the case that it is placed in water.

  The Simple Conditional Analysis may be challenged, but for our purposes it is adequate.
  We are interested in the broad form of the truth condition, and various more refined analyses share the same broad form.
  Note, in particular, that it being the case that \emph{C} and \emph{M} happening describes an event.
  Given appropriate conditions; salt dissolves, glass breaks, and I mumble when I am tired.
  The key idea is that the property of being disposed to \emph{M} when \emph{C} is analysed in terms of the (possible) event of \emph{M} happening when \emph{C}.

  The parallel to ability is established by noting that ability may also be analysed in terms of a (possible) event, as we have seen.
  In particular, by incorporating volition in the analysans of the Simple Conditional Analysis.
  To illustrate, \citeauthor{Mandelkern:2017aa} trace the Conditional Analysis of ability  to \textcite{Hume:1748tp} and \textcite{Moore:1912te}, among others:
  \begin{quote}
    S can \(\phi\) iff S would \(\phi\) if S tried to \(\phi\)\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\Citeyear[Cf.][308]{Mandelkern:2017aa})}
  \end{quote}
  Compare to the Simple Conditional Analysis of dispositions:
  The object is some agent \emph{S}, \emph{C} is `S tried to \(\phi\)' and \emph{M} is `S \(\phi\)s' --- it is volition alone which distinguishes the analyses.
  For example, I have the ability to demonstrate that a rectangle with dimensions \(19\text{cm}\) by \(7\text{cm}\) has area \(133\text{cm}^{2}\) only if I would demonstrate that a rectangle with dimensions \(19\text{cm}\) by \(7\text{cm}\) has area \(133\text{cm}^{2}\) if it were the case that I tried that a rectangle with dimensions \(19\text{cm}\) by \(7\text{cm}\) has area \(133\text{cm}^{2}\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Claiming support]
  Parallel analyses in hand, we now turn to claiming support.
  We start with dispositions.

  As with ability, there are various ways in which an agent may claim support that some object is disposed to \emph{M} when \emph{C}.
  For example, I may claim support that my shoes are disposed to squeak when wet because I have had sufficient occasion to observe the phenomenon.
  Likewise, I may claim support that any shoe of the same model is disposed to squeak when wet because I have traced the source of the squeak to a manufacturing choice.
  In short, support may be claimed by past event and shared properties.

  Still, take a novel act and a object pair.
  Personally, I have a empty fountain pen that I haven't placed in water.
  I claim that the fountain pen is disposed to float when placed in water.
  My reasoning is fairly simple.
  The fountain pen is quite light, especially so while empty of ink.
  And, the cap and loading mechanism seem to be quite well sealed, so the weight of the fountain pen will not increase by taking on water.
  So, given that the weight of the fountain pen will be unchanged, and given how light the pen is, it seems that the upward force exerted by the water against the fountain pen will be sufficient to keep the pen afloat.

  In short, I've noted a few properties of the pen, claimed support for a handful of others, and then considered what would happen.
  Our interest is with the last step.
  I appeal to, and use, the possible event.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    I may be wrong about the event, but that isn't at issue.
    It remains the case that I appeal to it.
  }
  The noted properties are relevant because they suggest that the event of floating would happen if it were the case that the fountain pen were placed in water.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The fountain pen is not the only object on my desk.
  Beside the fountain pen is a collection of instruments that I may use to investigate the fountain pen.
  And, stored in my mind is a basic understanding of fluid dynamics.

  If I were to measure the fountain pen, ensure that it is airtight, and appeal to some known facts, then an application of Archimedes' principle would allow me to demonstrate that the fountain pen is disposed to float when placed in water (of some specified density).
  Indeed, such a demonstration would be a straightforward refinement of the way in which I claimed support for the proposition that the pen is disposed to float when placed in water.

  Now, by similar reasoning I have claimed support for the proposition that I have the ability to demonstrate that the proposition that the pen is disposed to float when placed in water is true.
  Here, in addition to appealing to properties of the fountain pen, I also appealed to various mental properties.
  There is an important difference, however, regarding the relevant event.
  When reasoning about the disposition, the event is the fountain pen floating in water, but when reasoning about my ability to demonstrate the event is the demonstration --- a series of measurements and calculations.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Diverge]
  Now to turn to \EAS{}.

  If I have the ability, then it follows that the fountain floats in water.
  As noted above, it is not possible for me to demonstrate something that is not the case.

  Claim support for the proposition that the fountain floats in water.

  Still, disposition, fountain pen is not floating in water.
  Likewise with respect to ability, I have not demonstrated that the fountain pen floats in water.
  I noted various things, but did not piece these together into a demonstration.

  Yet, in claiming support, there's the event of demonstrating.
  And, so I appeal to those premises and steps I would use in the event.
  This is \EAS{}.

  Appeal to what happens in the event.
  And, reasoning to claim possible event is viewed in terms of ensuring that the resources are available.
  I have not used the relevant premises and steps of reasoning, nor am I clear on the specific form they will take.
  Still, they are available.

  Final point of interest, then.
  In both cases, there's an appeal to an event.
  If \EAS{} holds with respect to ability, does something similar hold with respect to dispositions?

  First, important clarification.
  The reasoning outlined for disposition was claiming support for event.
  Here, no clear issue with \ESU{}.
  Similarly, no clear issue with \ESU{} with respect to claiming support for having an ability.
  Tension with \ESU{} arises when using ability as a premise in further reasoning.

  Second, key divergence.
  Conclusion obtained is something that is true independent of ability.
  Unclear to me whether similar reasoning with dispositions.
  For, ability is about an event involving the agent.

  In addition, there is no issue with supposing that the agent reasons with (and hence uses) to all the relevant features of the event.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{There may me details of reasoning that one is not easily able to express, but it doesn't follow that those details are not used.}
  Ability is in part interesting because it is clear that an agent does not witness the relevant event.
  This is not to say that a variant of \EAS{} does not hold with respect to dispositions.
  Rather, I am expressing
  \begin{enumerate*}
  \item hesitancy that there are comparable entailments, and
  \item concern that there is no clear argumentative path.
  \end{enumerate*}
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Concluding parallel]
  To summarise.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Parallel between analysis of dispositions and abilities.
  \item Event in analysis of both.
  \item Reason about event.
  \item Motivation for \EAS{} by considering reason to and from event.
  \item This doesn't provide anything close to a clear theoretical account of the reasoning performed if \EAS{} is true, but it does hint at such at how developing such an account may be approached.
  \item Now turn to related conclusion.
  \item In turn, fill in some details on the account.
  \end{itemize}
