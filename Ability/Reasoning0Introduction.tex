\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:reasoning-introduction}

\begin{note}
  The purpose of this chapter is to introduce two ideas concerning reasoning --- specifically reasoning which concludes that some proposition \(\phi\) has some value \(v\).
  In contrast to {\color{red} chapter ???}, we will begin with a pair of definitions, and the two ideas will be motivated with reference to the definitions.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  {
    \color{red}
    The two definitions, and the corresponding ideas.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In relation to the broad argument, \ESU{} is what we're arguing against, and \EAS{}, what we're arguing for.
  More specifically, tension between \ideaCS{}, \ESU{}, and ability.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Tension, well, only \ESU{} really matters.
  And, \EAS{} is just the negation.
  So, \adB{}, this is something of a detour.

  However, the detour serves two purposes.
  First, clarify \ESU{}.
  Second, \EAS{}, our goal is not only to establish tension, but also to offer a resolution to the tension by rejecting \ESU{}.
  In this respect, \adB{} is important to motivate.

  Further, stated prior, and independently.
\end{note}

\section{Ideas \& definitions}
\label{sec:ideas}

\begin{note}
  The two key ideas of this chapter are \ESU{} and \EAS{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \targetESU*
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \goalEAS*
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Argue that \ESU{} when combined with \ideaCS{} leads to tension in certain cases.
  \EAS{} is, roughly, the negation of \ideaCS{}.
  Our interest with \EAS{} is from the perspective of motivating a rejection of \ESU{} as a resolution to the mentioned tension.

  For the primary argument of this document, then, may focus only on \ESU{}.
  Consideration of \EAS{} may be postponed for a second pass after determining whether the tension developed is of interest.

  Still, given that \ESU{} and \EAS{} are paired, deal with them simultaneously.
  Indeed, begin by providing a abstract characterisation of reasoning which satisfies \ESU{} and \EAS{}.
  Term these two types of reasoning `\adA{}' and `\adB{}'.

\begin{note}
  \defADA*
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \defADB*
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, \ESU{}, this is requiring that we always go with \adA{}.
  And, \EAS{}, some instances of \adB{}.
