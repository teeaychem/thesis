\section{History}

\begin{note}
  Started with idea about premises.

  Distinction between representation and content of representation.

  Fix something like a representation, but no content.

  One way to think about this, inchoate.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Key idea is something missing.
  Whatever relation typically holds between perspective of agent and action, weaken this.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Idea is hard to argue for.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Different approach.
  Relation holds in cases where agent has not done the think which typically characterises the relation.
\end{note}

\section{Starting}
\nocite{Brown:2004us}

\begin{note}
  Start with a instance of reasoning.

  Logic problem.

  \abgen{2} ability.
  Instance of \abgen{} ability.
  \abspec{2} ability.
  So \dots

  As an argument, somewhat difficult.
  \abspec{2} only if \abgen{}.
  So, no going from premises if don't already have the conclusion.

  Warrant transmission failure.
  Looks like this works to me.

  However, as an instance of reasoning, seems okay.
  Drawing out the consequences of \abgen{} ability.

  No warrant transmission.
  Link between \abgen{} and \abspec{}.
  No warrant for \abgen{} without warrant for \abspec{}.

  This falls short of an argument.
  Just highlights a possible way out.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Still, something less clear.
  Opportunity.
  \abspec{2} ability.

  Test whether really have the \abspec{} ability.

  But, also, \abspec{} and \abspec{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  There's no clear link to \citeauthor{Wright:2011wn}.

  For, with the cases I'm interested in, the problem arises because the agent has the \abgen{} ability (from their perspective).
  However, to apply transmission failure, it seems this would raise worries about ability.
  So, for me:
  I have \abgen{} ability, and if not an instance of \abgen{} then a problem, but is an instance so get conclusion.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  More general argument.
  Cases in which reasoning applies equally to premise-conclusion pairing have no witnessed from.

  This is the main focus of this document.
