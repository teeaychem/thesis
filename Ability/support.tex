\chapter{\ros{3}}
\label{cha:ros}

\begin{note}
  The present section develops and discusses \ros{1} in detail.

  The role of \ros{1} within this document is to capture, in a abstract way, the way in which a relation between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) holds from an \agpe{} when the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Our understanding of a `\ros{1}' is given in terms of three ideas, and subsections will develop and discuss each idea in detail:

  \begin{TOCEnum}
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:ros:I}

    An event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is sufficient for a \ros{} to hold, for the agent.
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:ros:W}

    An event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) provides an agent with a \wit{0} for a \ros{}.
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:ros:II}

    It is possible for a \ros{} to hold, from an \agpe{} without the agent having a \wit{} for the \ros{}.
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:ros:embedded}

    Useful distinction.

\section{\supportI{}}
\label{cha:ros:I}

\begin{note}
  \supportI{} states, roughly, that the event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is sufficient for a \ros{} to hold between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).%
  % \footnote{
  %   We speak in terms of \ros{1} holding from an \agpe{}.
  %   However, given some agent \vAgent{}, proposition \(\phi\), value \(v\), and \pool{} \(\Phi\), we do not distinguish between:

  %   \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), noitemsep]
  %   \item
  %     \label{ros:ap:maybe:a}
  %     A \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) holds, from an \agpe{}.
  %   \item
  %     \label{ros:ap:maybe:b}
  %     \propI{A \ros{} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\)}, \evaled{} \valI{True} by the agent.

  %     I.e.\ the \evalN{}:
  %     \(\pv{\propI{A \ros{} holds between } \pv{\phi}{v}\propI{ and }\Phi}{\valI{True}}\)
  %   \end{enumerate}

  %   \color{red}
  %   Any significant distinction would turn on details too specific for the degree of abstraction we target.

  \begin{idea}[\supportI{}]
    \label{idea:support}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{VAREnum}
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Proposition: \(\phi\)
      \item
        Value: \(v\)
      \item
        \pool{2}: \(\Phi\)
      \item
        Event: \(e\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{VAREnum}
    }
    For an agent \vAgent{}, a proposition-value pair \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), \pool{} \(\Phi\), and event \(e\):

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      When \vAgent{} \eval{1} \(\phi\) as having value \(v\) as a sub-event of \(e\):
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        A \emph{\ros{}} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) holds, from \agpe{\vAgent{}'}.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{idea}

  The focus on the sub-event in which the agent pairs \(\phi\) with \(v\) is to allow for the \ros{} to, in part, explain why the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) without requiring that the \ros{} holds, for the agent prior to the agent forming the conclusion that \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

  In this respect, a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) may be regarded as a static account of how the agent has come to pair \(\phi\) with \(v\).
  In other words, the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) just captures whatever it is, for the agent, that led to the agent concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  Still, \supportI{} is only a sufficient condition, and the suggestion --- however the details work out --- is intended as intuition for when the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  As we will see when discussing \supportII{}, we will deny the converse of \supportI{}.
  Therefore, the intuition is not suitable to capture in general what a \ros{} holding, from an \agpe{}, amounts to.

  Generalised, what it is, that has, is, or will, relate \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for the agent.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Given \supportI{}, a \ros{} holds \emph{from an \agpe{}}.
  Hence, we have no interest in whatever the idea of a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) simpliciter.
  As outlined in \autoref{cha:clar:sec:Concls:reasoning}, we place no restrictions on conclusions.
  Hence, if an agent concludes that the ratio of the long side to the short side of a piece of paper is not \(\sqrt{2}\) from some \pool{} \(\Phi\), then, by \supportI{}, a \ros{} holds between:
  \(\pv{\propI{The ratio of the long side to the short side of a piece of paper is not }\sqrt{2}}{\valI{True}}\) and \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
 \supportI{} is similar to, but designed to be distinct from,~\citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa}'s Taking Condition:%
  \footnote{
    There are various objections to~\citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa}'s Taking Condition, though we take no stance on whether~\citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa}'s Taking Condition holds.

    See, for example,~\textcite{Hlobil:2014tq}, \textcite{McHugh:2016vp}, and~\textcite{Wright:2014tt}.

    \citeauthor{Hlobil:2014tq} argues against the Taking Condition as it distracts from what accounts of reasoning out to explain, rather than arguing against the Taking Condition directly.

    \citeauthor{McHugh:2016vp} summarise various objects to the taking condition, and present district arguments against against (distinct) ideas in favour of the taking condition.
    In particular,~\supportI{} is closer to what \citeauthor{McHugh:2016vp} term the `Consequence Condition' (\citeyear[cf.][316]{McHugh:2016vp}), which \citeauthor{McHugh:2016vp} also (indirectly) argue against.
    However, \citeauthor{McHugh:2016vp} does not consider an alternative account of what distinguishes concluding from any other action, and as~\supportI{} is designed to capture this distinction, it is unclear to me whether \citeauthor{McHugh:2016vp}'s arguments apply to~\supportI{} (if, indeed, they are sound).

    \citeauthor{Wright:2014tt} denies that reasoning must involve a state which connects premises to conclusions, as discussed in the main body of this section. (\citeyear[Cf.][33-34]{Wright:2014tt})
  }

  \begin{quote}
    (Taking Condition):
    Inferring necessarily involves the thinker \emph{taking} his premises to support his conclusion and drawing his conclusion because of that fact.%
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[5]{Boghossian:2014aa})}
  \end{quote}

  There is an immediate superficial difference in that~\citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa} states the Taking Condition in terms of inferring.
  However, `a conclusion' may be substituted for `inferring' and an important distinction remains.
  For, `taking' is understood by \citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa} to be {
    \color{red}
    explanatory.

    However, for our purposes, \ros{1} will not have a direct explanatory role.
  Instead, \ros{1} are an abstraction.
}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa} illustrates with the following \scen{}:
  \begin{quote}
    On waking up one morning I recall that:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*), series=BogEx]
    \item
      \label{BogEx:1}
      It rained last night.
    \end{enumerate}

    I combine this with my knowledge that

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*), resume*=BogEx]
    \item
      \label{BogEx:2}
      If it rained last night, then the streets are wet.
    \end{enumerate}

    to conclude:

    So,

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*), resume*=BogEx]
    \item
      \label{BogEx:3}
      The streets are wet.
    \end{enumerate}
    This belief then affects my choice of footwear.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[2]{Boghossian:2014aa})}
  \end{quote}

  And \citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa} expands as follows:

  \begin{quote}
    [M]y inferring from~\ref{BogEx:1} and~\ref{BogEx:2} to~\ref{BogEx:3} must involve my arriving at the judgment that~\ref{BogEx:3} in part \emph{because} I \emph{take} the presumed truth of~\ref{BogEx:1} and~\ref{BogEx:2} to provide support for~\ref{BogEx:3}.
    Let us call this insistence that an account of inference must in this way incorporate a notion of ``taking'' the Taking Condition on inference.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[4]{Boghossian:2014aa})}
  \end{quote}

  Hence, for \citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa}, the Taking Condition captures something \emph{in addition} to~\ref{BogEx:3} being a conclusion from a \pool{} which includes~\ref{BogEx:1} and~\ref{BogEx:2}.
  The presence of `taking' has a distinctive role in classifying the move from~\ref{BogEx:1} and~\ref{BogEx:2} to~\ref{BogEx:3} as an inference (or as a conclusion).

  In contrast, we do not require that a \ros{} has any particular role \emph{for the agent} in event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  If an agent concludes~\ref{BogEx:3} from~\ref{BogEx:1} and~\ref{BogEx:2}, then a \ros{} holds between~\ref{BogEx:3} and \(\{\ref{BogEx:1}, \ref{BogEx:2}\}\), for the agent ---~\ref{BogEx:3} and \(\{\ref{BogEx:1}, \ref{BogEx:2}\}\) are related, in some way by the agent.
  However, the \ros{} between~\ref{BogEx:3} and \(\{\ref{BogEx:1}, \ref{BogEx:2}\}\) need not itself have a role in the \agents{} conclusion of~\ref{BogEx:3} from \(\{\ref{BogEx:1}, \ref{BogEx:2}\}\).%
  \footnote{
    Also, about the type of reasoning by which the agent concludes.
    This comes from \textcite{Boghossian:2008vf,Boghossian:2012vb}.
    Rule following, taking gets account of rule.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \phantlabel{Wright-simple-supportI}
  Indeed, our intuitive understanding of \ros{} is close to \citeauthor{Wright:2014tt}'s (\citeyear{Wright:2014tt}) `Simple Proposal':
  \begin{quote}
    [C]onsider instead the proposal, not that the status of the transition as inferential depends on the thinker's judgments about his reasons, but that it depends on \emph{what his reasons are}.
    We want his acceptance of the premises to supply his \emph{actual} reasons for accepting the conclusion.
    [\dots]

    Call this the Simple Proposal.
    It says that a thinker infers q from p\(_{1}\) \(\cdots\) p\(_{\text{n}}\) when he accepts each of p\(_{1}\) \(\cdots\) p\(_{\text{n}}\), moves to accept q, and does so for the reason that he accepts p\(_{1}\) \(\cdots\) p\(_{\text{n}}\).%
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[33]{Wright:2014tt})}
  \end{quote}

  \citeauthor{Wright:2014tt}'s simple proposal is that, for the agent, the relation between a conclusion and some \pool{} need not be part of what moves the agent to conclude the conclusion from the \pool{}.

  \begin{quote}
    What is needed, then, is an account of, or at least some insight into, what it is for certain intentional states of a thinker to be his actual reasons for his transition to another intentional state.
    \dots
    We need to avoid committing to the notion that doing something for certain reasons must involve a state that somehow registers those reasons as reasons for what one does.\newline
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[34]{Wright:2014tt})}
  \end{quote}

  Still, anticipating the role of \ros{} in construction a variation to \qWhy{}, it intuitively remains the case that a \ros{} explains, in part, why an agent concluded the conclusion from the \pool{} for, the \ros{} captures \emph{that} the agent accepted each of the premises and moved to accept the conclusion (in \citeauthor{Wright:2014tt}'s terminology).

  Still, following the discussion above, there is an important between~\supportI{} and \citeauthor{Wright:2014tt}'s Simple Proposal.
  For,~\supportI{} is an entailment, while \citeauthor{Wright:2014tt}'s Simple Proposal is an identity statement.
  Inferring, on the Simple Proposal, is an agent accepting some conclusion for the reason that they accept premises from some \pool{}.
  \supportI{} does not entail that concluding is nothing more than moving to accept \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) as a result of accepting each element of \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\section{\wit{3} for \ros{1}}
\label{cha:ros:W}

\begin{note}
  \autoref{cha:ros:I} introduced a sufficient condition for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) to hold, from an \agpe{}:
  The agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  In general, if an agent has concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), then we will say the agent has a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
  In full:

  \begin{definition}[A \wit{2} for a \ros{0}]
    \label{def:witnessing}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{VAREnum}
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Proposition: \(\phi\)
      \item
        Value: \(v\)
      \item
        \pool{2}: \(\Phi\)
      \item
        Event: \(e\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{VAREnum}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(e\) is \emph{\wit{0}} for \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for \vAgent{}.
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  Shorthand, we say that \emph{an agent has} a \wit{0} for the relevant \ros{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  An important, but trivial, case of \autoref{def:witnessing} is when an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  For, if an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) then it is immediate that there is some event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) --- the very same event --- and hence the agent has a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).

  Hence, joining \supportI{} with \autoref{def:witnessing}, we have the following:

  \begin{proposition}[A conclusion entails witnessed \support{}]
    \label{prop:cws}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{VAREnum}
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Proposition: \(\phi\)
      \item
        Value: \(v\)
      \item
        \pool{2}: \(\Phi\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{VAREnum}
    }
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      If \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) then:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        When \vAgent{} pairs \(\phi\) with \(v\) as a sub-event of \(e\), a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) holds, from \agpe{\vAgent{}'}.
      \item
        There is an event \(e'\) such that \(e'\) is a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:cws}
    Immediate for assuming the antecedent and appealing to \supportI{} and \autoref{def:witnessing}, respectively.
  \end{argument}

  \autoref{prop:cws} is of interest with respect to \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, \issueInclusion{}, and the variations to follow in \autoref{cha:var}.

  For, our variant to \qWhy{} will involve \ros{1}.
  Our variant to \qHow{} will involve \wit{1}.
  And, our variant to \issueInclusion{} will hold that a \ros{} is, in part, an answer to why an agent concluded only if the agent has a \wit{} for the \ros{}.

  Hence, \autoref{prop:cws} ensures that so long as there is an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), then an answer to `why' will always have a corresponding answer to `how'.

  At issue is whether it is always the case that an agent has a \wit{} for a \ros{} which is, in part, an answer to why the agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  And, given \autoref{prop:cws} it is immediate that any such \ros{} must be distinct from the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Note, when we talk of \wit{1} we talk in terms of `having a \wit{0}'.
  In the case of \autoref{prop:cws}, the event in which the agent concludes and the event which secures the relevant \wit{} are identical.

  However, event \(e\) may be an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) such that throughout the event \(e\), the agent has a \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\), such that the event \(e'\) which \wit{1} the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is distinct from \(e\).

  Hence, our understanding of `having a \wit{0}' allows for the possibility that some \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\), in part, `answers why' an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) though the relevant \wit{0} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is distinct.
  The variant to \issueInclusion{} we develop is compatible with such cases.
  Still, it is safe to ignore this possibility.
  We will not directly, at least, consider such cases or take a stand either way in the main argument.%
  \footnote{
    \phantlabel{fn:past-witness}
    To illustrate, consider an agent working on some mathematical problem.

    As part of their work on the problem the agent concludes the hypotenuse of some right-angled triangle is \(\sqrt{74}\text{cm}\) by use of the Pythagorean theorem.
    Further, the agent has, at some point in the past proved the Pythagorean theorem from more basic principles.

    Perhaps the agent concludes the hypotenuse of the triangle is \(\sqrt{74}\text{cm}\), in part, from those more basic principles.
    Perhaps in general it is true that if a agent concluded \(X\) from \(Y\) and \(Y\) from \(Z\), then the agent, in part at least, concluded \(X\) from \(Z\).

    On the other hand perhaps the more basic principles have no role explanatory role in the present.
    The agent only appealed to the theorem, rather than any basic principles.

    Though we will not take a stand on whether a relevant \wit{0} for some conclusion is distinct from the event in which the agent concludes, the first option highlights an issue with \autoref{def:witnessing}.
    Consider an agent working through a proof of some theorem \(\theta\), and let \(\Theta\) be the relevant \pool{}.
    Our interest is with the conclusion \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).

    Suppose the agent reasons to \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
    Further, suppose the \agents{} reasoning is sound.
    However, the agent is worried about some parts of their reasoning.
    Hence, given their worries, \emph{reasons} to --- but does not conclude --- \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).

    Some time later the agent resolves their worries and concludes the theorem is true.
    I see no issue with the possibility that:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item
      When the agent revisited the proof, they concluded \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
    \item
      In part, a \ros{} between \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) and \(\Theta\), from the \agpe{}, answers why the agent concluded \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
    \item
      The event in which the agent reasoned to \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\) answers, in part, how the agent \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\) by being a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) and \(\Theta\).
    \end{itemize}

    However, the idea is incompatible with the way a \wit{0} is understood.
    For, by definition, the event which serves as a \wit{0} must be an event in which the agent \emph{concludes} \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
    And, by construction of the \scen{0}, the \agents{} worries prevent the agent from forming the relevant conclusion.

    So, perhaps \autoref{def:witnessing} should be revised so that an event \(e\) may serve as a \wit{} to some \ros{} without being an event in which an agent concludes.
    However, providing an adequate characterisation of the relevant event is difficult.
    That the agent \emph{reasoned} to \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\) is insufficient.

    For example, consider a variation of the \scen{} in which the agent identifies a problem with the proof.
    Given the presence of a problem, there may be no \ros{} for the agent to have a \wit{0} for.

    Rather than attempt to characterise \ros{1} independently of conclusions, we keep the present definitions.

\end{note}

\section{\supportII{}}
\label{cha:ros:II}

\begin{note}
  \supportI{} states that a \ros{} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for the agent, when an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
  Roughly, \supportII{} denies the converse of \supportI{}:

  \begin{idea}[\supportII{}]
    \label{idea:support:possible}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{VAREnum}
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Proposition: \(\phi\)
      \item
        Value: \(v\)
      \item
        \pool{2}: \(\Phi\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{VAREnum}
    }
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Conditional does \emph{not} necessarily hold for all \(\phi\), \(v\), \(\Psi\):

      \begin{itenum}
      \item[\emph{If}:]
        \label{idea:support:possible:ros}
        A \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) holds, from \agpe{\vAgent{}'}.
      \item[\emph{Then}:]
        Either:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
        \item
          \label{idea:support:possible:noWit}
        \vAgent{} has a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
      \item
        {
          \color{blue}
          There is some event in which \vAgent{} was concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
        }
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{itenum}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{idea}

  If an agent does not have a \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), then there is no event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  So, \supportI{} states that an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is sufficient for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) to hold, for the agent.
  In contrast, \supportII{} denies that an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is necessary for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) to hold, for the agent.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \supportII{} has a key role in the overall argument for this document.
  For, as indicated, answers to the variant of \qWhy{} will concern \ros{}, and the variant of \qHow{} will concern whether the agent has a \wit{} for the relevant \ros{}.
  \supportII{}, then, allows for the \emph{possibility} that the kind of thing which answers, in part, why an agent concluded is not constrained by how the agent concluded.

  However, our motivation for \supportII{} is independent of the success of the overall argument of this document.

  In short, any constraint on answers to why an agent concludes by answers to how an agent concludes is substantial.
  Denying that there is any instance in which a \ros{} may answer, in part, why an agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) without the agent having a \wit{} for the \ros{} amounts to a substantive constraint.

  Indeed, \supportII{} should not be of any immediate concern.
  For, there is a significant gap between:

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    There being a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) from an \agpe{} without the agent having a \wit{} for the \ros{}.
  \item
    The \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\), for the agent, answering, in part, and in some sense, why the agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\paragraph*{\ros{3} and the basing relation \hfill (Optional)}

\begin{note}
  Think of \ros{} in terms of doxastic justification.

  \begin{quote}
    S's belief that p is doxastically justified (i.e. S's belief is held in an epistemically permissible fashion) if and only if S believes p in the right kind of way, on an epistemically appropriate basis.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear{Bondy:2018tk})}
  \end{quote}

  However, there are difficulties:

  From \supportII{}, \ros{} without conclusion.

  This means don't need to believe, at least with understanding on which beliefs are sort of explicit.

  This may suggest propositional justification.%
  \footnote{
    See (\cite{Firth:1978vi}) and (\cite[esp.\ fn.1]{Silva:2020aa}).
  }
  And, there are accounts of propositional justification which work in this way.
  Consider, for example, \citeauthor{Goldman:1979ui}'s account of \emph{ex ante} justification in terms of \emph{ex post} justification (\citeyear[351--352]{Goldman:1979ui}) and \citeauthor{Turri:2010aa}'s account of propositional justification in terms of possessing means for doxastic justification (\citeyear[320]{Turri:2010aa}).

  However, \supportI{} is then at issue.
  For, a conclusion does not, in general, entail propositional justification.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Further, we have no interest in justification.
  Again, this is not because anything will turn on cases where an agent lacks justification.
  Rather, do not wish to make the distinction.
  Ideas apply to cases in which an agent has justification, and lacks justification.

\section{Embedded \ros{1}}
\label{cha:ros:embedded}

\begin{note}
  The present section concerns, for some arbitrary proposition-value pair \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \pool{} \(\Psi\), the distinction between:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
  \item
    \label{Embed:no}
    A \ros{0} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
  \item
    \label{Embed:yes}
    A \ros{0} between \(\Phi\) and \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), where:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\Phi\) contains:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \(\pv{\propI{A \ros{} between }\pv{\psi}{v'}\propI{ and }\Psi}{\valI{True}}\)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}

  \ref{Embed:no} is a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
  By contrast, \ref{Embed:yes} is a \ros{0} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) which \emph{involves} a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\)%
  ---%
  the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is occurs in a premise of the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).

  If \ros{} occurs within some premise of a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), we say the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is \emph{embedded} within the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  It need not be the case that an agent has a \wit{0} for a \ros{0} in order for \ros{} to be involved in answering \qWhyV{}.

  For, suppose an agent does not have a \wit{0} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
  The upshot of the distinction between~\ref{Embed:no} and~\ref{Embed:yes} is as follows:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If the \ros{0} of \ref{Embed:no} is, in part, an answer to \qWhyV{} then the \ros{0} is a counterexample to \issueConstraint{}.
  \item
    If the \ros{0} of \ref{Embed:yes} is, in part, an answer to \qWhyV{} then the \ros{0} is \emph{not} a counterexample to \issueConstraint{}.
  \end{itemize}

  The difference is \emph{the way in which} the \ros{} functions with respect to the agent pairing \(\phi\) with \(v\).
  Whether the \ros{} functions as a premise when the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), or whether the \ros{} functions in a way that is different to a premise.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Embedding of this kind will be:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    Useful for relating the variations of \qWhy{} and \qHow{} to theories of concluding, or related phenomena. And,
  \item
    Important for clarifying a difficult for developing counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Definitions}
\label{cha:var:ros:Emb:defs}

\begin{note}
  In full, we define embedding in the following way:%
  \footnote{
    We assume, in general, that if a proposition \(\phi\) includes some other proposition \(\phi'\), then if \(\pv{\phi}{\valI{True}} \in \Phi\) then \(\pv{\phi'}{\valI{True}} \in \Phi\).
    In other words, if \(\pv{\phi'\text{ and }\phi''}{\valI{True}} \in \Phi\) then both \(\pv{\phi'}{\valI{True}} \in \Phi\) and \(\pv{\phi''}{\valI{True}} \in \Phi\).
    We do not extend this assumption to values other than `True'.
  }

  \begin{definition}[Degree of embedding withing a \ros{}]
    \label{def:embedding:degree}
    For a proposition-value pairs \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\), \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), \pool{} \(\Phi\), and \(i \in \mathbb{N}\):

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) has a \emph{degree of embedding \(1\)} with respect to a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) if and only if \(\pv{\psi}{v'} \in \Phi\).
    \item
      \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is has a \emph{degree of embedding \(i\)} with respect to a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) if and only if:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        There exists some \(\pv{\theta}{v''}\) and \(\Theta\) such that:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item
          \(\pv{\psi}{v'} \in \Theta\)
        \item
          \(\pv{\propI{A \ros{} between }\pv{\theta}{v''}\propI{ and }\Theta}{\valI{True}}\) has degree of embedding \(i - 1\) with respect to the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  The cases of interest to us are where \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is embedded within in a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), no matter the degree of embedding:

  \begin{definition}[Embedding within a \ros{}]
    \label{def:embedding}
    For a proposition-value pairs \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\), \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), and a \pool{} \(\Phi\):


    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is \emph{embedded} within in a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\)
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is has a degree of embedding \(i\) with respect to the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for some \(i \in \mathbb{N}\).
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  The definition of an embedding covers arbitrary proposition-value pairs.
  However, the cases of embedding of interest to us are where \ros{1} are embedded within a \ros{}.
  A final definition captures when this is the case:

  \begin{definition}[Embedded \ros{1}]
    For a proposition-value pairs \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\), \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), and \pool{1} \(\Phi\), \(\Psi\):

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is \emph{embedded} within the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      For some proposition-value pair \(\pv{\chi}{v''}\) in \(\Phi\):
      \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item
        \(\chi\) is the proposition: \propI{A \ros{} between }\pv{\psi}{v'}\propI{ and }\Psi.
      \item
        \(v''\) is the value: \valI{True}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Idea is somewhat familiar from distinction between object- and meta-language with respect to propositional logic.
  Certain kind of equivalence between proof and conditional.
  It is possible to find a corresponding conditional to any proof with a finite number of premises, proof captures derivation of conclusion from premises.

  Corresponding conditional is not a premise, nor any part, of the proof.

  For example, consider a proof from \(P\) and \(P \rightarrow Q\) to \(Q\) by conditional detachment.
  Corresponding conditional is \((P \land (P \rightarrow Q)) \rightarrow Q\).
  However, not part of the proof.

  Intuitive distinction between what a proof and a conditional refer to.
  However, informally there is no difficulty in treating a proof as a premise.
  \(P\), and I have a proof of \(P \rightarrow Q\), therefore \(Q\).
