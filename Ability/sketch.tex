\subsection{\zS{}}
\label{sec:zs}

\paragraph{\zSN{0}}

\begin{note}[`\zSN{0}']
  Particular kind of support.
  \zSN{0}, or, rather, \zS{}.

  Is it the case that agent may fail to conclude?

  Additional property of relation of \support{}.
  If agent concludes, not only support, but \zS{}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \support{2}: premises and conclusion.
  \item
    \zS{}: checks.
  \end{itemize}

  In various cases, \support{} only if \zS{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{idea}
    In cases of \zS{}:

    If agent were to take up option and fail to conclude, no support.
  \end{idea}
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Limitation and closure condition]
  So, conversely.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Support \emph{only if} not the case that if the agent were to take up the option, would fail to conclude.
  \end{itemize}

  Simply:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Support \emph{only if} if the agent were to take up the option, would not fail to conclude.
  \end{itemize}

  Here, turned into a closure condition.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}

  Now, an important thing to note here is that we're not characterising a distinct instance of support.
  Rather, we have these additional constraints on the agent's epistemic state which, in turn, constrain support.

  Here, then, in part explanation why.

  For, support, only if conditional holds.
\end{note}


\paragraph{More broadly}

\begin{note}
  Key thing, check.
  Prior to concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from some pool of premises \(\Phi\), check on whether it makes sense, from agent's perspective, to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  In particular, cases where, if \(\phi\) has value \(v\) then it is possible for the agent to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from some pool of premises \(\Psi\).
  Here, permutations.
  Of interest for the moment:
  \(\phi = \psi\) but \(\Phi \ne \Psi\).
  However, also \(\phi \ne \psi\) and \(\Phi \ne \Psi\).

  Keys.

  This prevents.

  Parcel delivered, check the address before opening.

  Cases go the other way.
  Check is satisfied.

  Wason selection task.
  Here, it is clear what needs to be checked.
  If this proposition is true, then these things are possible.

  Here, consistent with witnessing.
  Turned over cards, then fine.
  Haven't reasoned from place to absence of keys.

  Many instances are.

  Relative, so long as conclusion is true.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Not all concluding is like this]
  Not all concluding is like this.
  Testimony.
  No way to check.
  Of course, may be various ways to check the sources.
  However, focus on novel conclusions.
\end{note}

\section{Supplements}
\label{sec:overview:supplements}

\subsection{Back to testimony (and a variant of \zS{})}

\begin{note}
  The key difference between these two cases is:
  With multiplication and division, or syntax and semantics, question is about the agent's reasoning from premises to conclusion.

  However, with testimony, the question is with whether the premise of testimony is a good premise.
  So, if you already think testimony, then as testimony is factive, there wouldn't be a problem in concluding from testimony.
  Key is statement of testimony.
  In some sense, there is something puzzling.
  For, different conclusion then either calculator or own reasoning is mistaken.
  But, in the scenario we have specified testimony.

  The thing is, whether leave the premises fixed.

  Variant of \zS{}.
  Here, query premises, rather than the conclusion.
  Set this aside.

  Part of what makes \zS{} interesting is no revisions.
  In this respect, quite different to something like \citeauthor{Wright:2011wn} on transmission of warrant.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Calculator.
  Check to see whether or not it's functioning correctly.
  Understanding of arithmetic.
  If fail to conclude sum, then calculator is no good.

  \zS{}.
  Again, key point here is that if something else, then wouldn't conclude.

  Conclude sum from calculator only if conclude sum from understanding of arithmetic.

  But, may also go for calculator over own reasoning.
  Especially when tired, or stressed.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  {
    Right, the key thing is that there are two sources of information.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Testimony
    \item
      Understanding of arithmetic
    \end{itemize}
    What matters is that these align.
    So long as you have this, then when you get a new piece of information from either, expectation that both sources will provide the same information.
    If break equivalence between the two sources, then neither works.
    Here, each may function separately.

    Keeping parity.

    So, how really isn't all that important.
