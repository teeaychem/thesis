\chapter{Counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}}
\label{cha:ces}

\begin{note}
  This chapter states sufficient conditions for counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
  We then highlight the way (a plausible reading of) \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F} provides hypothetical counterexample to \issueInclusion{}.
  And, with your co-operation, make a real counterexample to \issueInclusion{}.
\end{note}



\section{\typeAdj{2} counterexamples}
\label{sec:counterexamples}


\begin{note}
  \autoref{cha:requs} introduced the idea of a \requ{} and \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces} (\autopageref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}) highlighted the way \requ{1} may provide counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
  Recall, in particular, \requ{1} are defined as follows:

  \reDefinition{def:requ}

  \noindent%
  In \autoref{cha:typical} we introduced the idea of an agent \tCV{} and linked the \tpro{} of a \torNa{} to \fc{1} given certain conditions are satisfied.

  The key idea of an agent \tCV{} is to provide sufficient conditions for \fc{1} which do not need to be made prior to the \agents{} conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).%
  \footnote{
    See \autopageref{cha:typical} for motivation on this point.
  }

  So, given certain conditions an agent \tCV{} provides sufficient conditions for Clause~\ref{def:requ:fc} of \autoref{def:requ}.
  And, in turn, a more detail account of the way \requ{1} may provide counterexamples to \issueInclusion{} by extending \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}.
  \autoref{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces} states the relevant conditions in full:

  \begin{proposition}[\tCV{3} and failures of \issueInclusion{}]
    \label{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      Conditions \ref{prop:hinge:X:tCed}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:act:se}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:tC}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc} hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=\arabic*]
      \item
        \label{prop:hinge:X:tCed}
        \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} (\typeAdv{}) concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) (by \torNa{} \(T\)).
      \item
        \label{prop:hinge:X:e:act:se}
        \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
      \item
        \label{prop:hinge:X:tC}
        \(\ed{\flat}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by \torNa{} \(T\).
      \item
        \label{prop:hinge:X:e:pro}
        \(\tproS{}\) is a projection of type \(T\) with respect to \(\ed{}\) \vAgent{}.
      \item
        \label{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc}
        For some event \(\edn{}\) and \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pair \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) in \(\tproS{}\):
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=\theenumi\alph*]
        \item
          \label{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc:i}
          \(\edn{\sharp}\) is the result of an action \(a\) done by \vAgent{} in \(\ed{\flat}\).
        \item
          \label{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc:ii}
          \vAgent{} \evals{} \(\psi'\) as having value \(v''\) prior to doing \(a\), for each \prop{0}-\val{0} pair \(\pv{\psi'}{v''}\) in \(\Psi\).
        \item
          \label{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc:iii}
          \vAgent{} does not have a \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) when \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \issueInclusion{} does not hold.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces}
    Suppose \ref{prop:hinge:X:tCed}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:act:se}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:tC}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc} hold.
    \medskip

    \noindent%
    Clauses~\ref{def:requ:se} and~\ref{def:requ:fc} of the definition of a \requ{} are satisfied with respect to \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\), \(\Psi\), \(\ed{}\), and \(\ed{\flat}\):

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., ref=\Alph*]
    \item
      By Clause~\ref{prop:hinge:X:e:act:se}, \(\ed{\flat}\) is assumed to be a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
    \item
      By \autoref{prop:tCV-fc} (\autopageref{prop:tCV-fc}).

      Specifically, clauses \ref{prop:hinge:X:tC}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro}, and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc} include the conditions of \autoref{prop:tCV-fc}.
      Hence, by \autoref{prop:tCV-fc}, \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is a \fc{0} from \(\Psi\) for the agent through \(\ed{\flat}\).
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    So, \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) being a \fc{} from \(\Psi\) through \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \requ{} of \(\ed{}\) by \autoref{def:requ}.
    And, by Condition~\ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc:iii} the agent does not have a \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) when \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    Hence, by \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}, \issueInclusion{} does not hold.%
    \footnote{
      Note, the argument for \autoref{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces} only assumes \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      The role of \tCV{} is limited to the event \(\edn{\flat}\) in which the conclusion of \(\edn{}\) is in progress.
      Still, as \(\ed{\flat}\) is an event in which the agent is \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by \torNa{} \(T\), and \(\ed{}\) happens as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\), it is natural for \(\ed{}\) to be an event in which \vAgent{} \typeAdv{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by \torNa{} \(T\).
    }
  \end{argument}

\section{Counterexamples}
\label{sec:counter-samples}


\begin{note}
  With \autoref{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces} in hand, our final task is to show there are cases in which Conditions \ref{prop:hinge:X:tCed}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:act:se}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:tC}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc} hold.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  We provide (plausible) hypothetical counterexample by returning to \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.
  We then, with your help, make a counterexample.
\end{note}



\subsection{A (plausible) hypothetical counterexample}


\begin{note}
  \begin{application}[\autoref{illu:gist:roots:F} and the failure of \issueInclusion{}]%
    \label{app:sc1-ce}%
    There is a plausible reading of \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F} for which \issueInclusion{} does not hold.
  \end{application}

  \begin{dets}{app:sc1-ce}
    Our goal is to show conditions \ref{prop:hinge:X:tCed}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:act:se}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:tC}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc} of \autoref{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces} are satisfied under a plausible reading of \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.

    The event and descriptions of interest are familiar from previous applications:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\edn{}\) is the event described by \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.
    \item
      \(\edo{}\) is the description:
      `The agent concludes \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\)'.
    \item
      \(\edn{\flat}\) covers Step~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor} of the \agents{} reasoning in \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.
    \item
      \(\edo{\flat}\) is the description:
      `The agent figures out \rootsConEqFac{} with the aim to identify the factors of \rootsConEq{}'.
    \end{itemize}
    %
    Where, as before, \(\Phi\) captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation prior to \(\edn{}\).

    We now highlight the way conditions \ref{prop:hinge:X:tCed}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:act:se}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:tC} are satisfied in turn:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      \(\edo{}\) is true of \(\ed{}\).
      Hence, \(\ed{}\) is an event in which the agent concludes \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\).%
    \footnote{
      Further, \(\ed{}\) satisfies to optional typical component of Condition~\ref{prop:hinge:X:tCed}, where the relevant \torNa{} is factorisation by reasoning similar to that found in \autoref{prop:p-t} (\autopageref{prop:p-t}).

      In short, the only way for an agent to concludes \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from a \pool{} which captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation is for the agent to factor.
    }
  \item
    By \autoref{obs:se-inst} (\autopageref{obs:se-inst}) --- which argues \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
  \item
    By a mix of \autoref{obs:se-inst} and \autoref{prop:p-t} (\autopageref{prop:p-t}).

    For, by \autoref{obs:se-inst}, \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
    Hence, by Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} of the definition of a \se{} (\autoref{def:se}, \autopageref{def:se}), \(\ed{\flat}\) is such that \(\ed{}\) is in progress.
    In other words, \(\ed{\flat}\) is an event in which the agent is concluding \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\).
    And, as \(\Phi\) captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation, \autoref{prop:p-t} entails \(\edo{\flat}\) is an event in which the agent is \tCV{} \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\) by factorisation.
  \end{enumerate}

  Conditions \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc} concern some \tpro{} \(\mathbb{P}\).
  The \tpro{} of interest is given by \autoref{app:sc1-typ} (\autopageref{app:sc1-typ}) which argued, there is a plausible reading of \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F} such that:
  %
  \begin{quote}
    There is a \tpro{} \(\mathbb{P}\) which consists of:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \prop{2}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings, for each \(n\) in \(\rootsConAltSet{}\), such that:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        The \pool{} contains an equation of the form \rootsConEqGen{}.
      \item
        The \prop{0}-\val{0} pair is of the form \pv{\propI{\rootsConGen{}}}{\valI{True}}, where \(m \times (m - 1) = n\).
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      Events \(\edn{\ast}\) such that:
      \(\edn{\ast}\) is the outcome of an action done by \vAgent{} in \(\edn{\flat}\).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{quote}
  %
  The \tpro{} \(\mathbb{P}\) satisfies Condition \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro}.
  And, by inspection, each \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} and event pairing in the \tpro{} \(\mathbb{P}\) satisfy sub-conditions \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc:i} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc:ii} of Condition~\ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc}.

  So, the only task which remains is to argue it is plausible the agent does not have a \wit{} for a \ros{} between some \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairing in \(\mathbb{P}\).
  I take it to be plausible the agent is concluding \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\) though the agent has never concluded, e.g.\ \rootsConGenV{5}{4} from a \pool{} which contains \rootsConEqV{20}.%
  \footnote{
    I'm fairly confident I did this in the course of developing this document.
    Though, as I do not have recollection of every instance of factorisation I've done, I'm not certain.
  }%

\begin{note}
  With \autoref{app:sc1-ce} the argument of this document is almost complete.
  Plausibly, \issueInclusion{} does not hold.

  Still, a counterexample to \issueInclusion{} requires an (actual) event\dots
\end{note}



\subsection{A counterexample}
\label{sec:counterexample}


\begin{note}
  For a counterexample to \issueInclusion{}, I assume you have some familiarity with Sudoku puzzles.
  If not, the relevant background information required amounts to two points:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A Sudoku grid \(9 \times 9\) grid built from \(9\) \(3 \times 3\) grids.
  \item
    A Sudoku puzzle is solved \emph{if and only if} each row, column, and \(3 \times 3\) grid of the Sudoku grid contain the numbers \(1\) through to \(9\).
  \end{itemize}
  %
  With the above information in hand, consider the following \scen{0}:

  \begin{scenario}[Sudoku puzzles]%
    \label{illu:gist:sudoku}%
    % https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/91422/tikz-sudoku-circle-and-connect-with-lines-some-cells
    An agent (you) who has an understanding of Sudoku solves the Sudoku puzzle on the left (though does not work on the Sudoku puzzle on the right).

\begin{note}
  Our goal is to establish the conditions of \autoref{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces} are satisfied.

  So, let:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(\Phi\) be a pool of premises which includes your understanding of Sudoku.
  \item
    \(\edn{}\) be the event in which you concluded each cell in the left Sudoku grid is correct.
  \item
    \(\edo{}\) is the description: `You conclude each cell in the left Sudoku grid is correct from \(\Phi\).'
  \item
    \(\edn{\flat}\) be the event in which you concluded \pv{\propI{The value of the centre cell of the left puzzle is 8}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\).
  \item
    \(\edo{\flat}\) is the description: `You conclude \pv{\propI{The value of the centre cell of the left puzzle is 8}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\) with the aim of solving the Sudoku puzzle.'
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  As with \autoref{app:sc1-ce}, our goal is to establish conditions \ref{prop:hinge:X:tCed}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:act:se}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:tC}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc} of \autoref{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces} are satisfied.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Condition~\ref{prop:hinge:X:tCed} is straightforward.
  \(\ed{}\) is an event in which you conclude conclude each cell in the left Sudoku grid is correct.

  Condition \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:act:se} follows similar reasoning to \autoref{obs:se-inst} (\autopageref{obs:se-inst}).
  In short:
  % 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} of \autoref{def:se} is satisfied as you when you conclude \pv{\propI{The value of the centre cell of the left puzzle is 8}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\) with the aim of solving the Sudoku puzzle an event in which you conclude each cell in the left Sudoku grid is correct is in progress.
  \item
    Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:hCon} of \autoref{def:se} is satisfied as it makes no sense for you to conclude you conclude each cell in the left Sudoku grid is correct from a \pool{} which includes you understanding of Sudoku puzzles if the conclusion does not partly happen as a result of correctly identifying the centre cell.
 \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Conditions~\ref{prop:hinge:X:tC}, \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc} concern a \torNa{} and some \tpro{} \(\mathbb{P}\).

  The name of the relevant \torNa{} is irrelevant.
  What matters is that there is some generality to your reasoning, and this is surely the case.
  You concluded conclude each cell in the left Sudoku grid is correct from a \pool{} which includes your understanding of Sudoku.
  And, your understanding of Sudoku surely extends to other Sudoku grids.

  In particular, the puzzle on the right is designed to be of equal difficulty to the puzzle of the left.
  So, your reasoning had some generality just in case there is a (possible) event in which you solve the puzzle on the right.

  Further, though you did not work on the Sudoku puzzle on the right, you may have at any moment decided to abandon the puzzle of the left.
  Hence, through \(\ed{\flat}\) you may have done the action `attempt to solve the puzzle on the right', and after doing the action you must have been concluding, e.g., \pv{\propI{The value of the centre cell of the right puzzle is 4}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\), as a solved Sudoku grid requires a number in each cell.

  So, the (possible) event noted and \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairing \pv{\propI{The value of the centre cell of the right puzzle is 4}}{\valI{True}}-\(\Phi\) amounts to a \tpro{}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  With a \torNa{} identified (though not by name) and \tpro{} found, conditions~\ref{prop:hinge:X:tC} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro} of \autoref{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces} are satisfied.

  The final task is to ensure Condition~\ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc} is satisfied.
  By construction, sub-conditions \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc:i} and \ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc:ii} are satisfied.

  And, as you did not work on the Sudoku puzzle on the right Sub-condition~\ref{prop:hinge:X:e:pro:fc:iii} is satisfied, as there is no event prior or present to \(\edn{}\) in which you concluded \pv{\propI{The value of the centre cell of the right puzzle is 4}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\).%
  \footnote{
    This does maybe require some fortune.
    If you have solved Sudoku puzzles in the past, there is a chance you solved the Sudoku puzzled on the right, and in particular concluded \pv{\propI{The value of the centre cell of the right puzzle is 4}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\).
    Though, \citeauthor{Berthier:2010aa} estimate the number of distinct minimal puzzles (puzzles where no cell may be removed without allowing for multiple solutions) to be (roughly) \(3.1055^{37}\).
  }
\end{note}


\paragraph*{Broad intuition}



\begin{note}
  With this a recap of \qWhy{} and \qHow{} may be helpful.

  \qWhy{}, why you concluded each cell in the left Sudoku grid is correct from \(\Phi\), rather than some other event.
  For example, taking a bath, or making Sudoku soup by filling the grid with random numbers.

  In some cases, there is an sub-event, in progress.
  This favours the event.
  However, favours the event only if other events are possible.

  In \scen{0}, the event in which you concluded \pv{\propI{The value of the centre cell of the left puzzle is 8}}{\valI{True}} from \(\Phi\).
  Need to get this, and in turn favours.

  Key is \pool{}.
  Understanding of Sudoku.

  However, this understanding entails some generality.
  Other Sudoku puzzles, and hence conclusions about which number fills particular cells.

  So, in the same way sub-event favours event, also get other events.

  \ros{} captures `following from'.

  In turn, \qHow{} question how the event happened.
  Which conclusions did you make?
  It is clear you did not work on the other Sudoku puzzle.

  So, answers to \qWhy{} are not constrained by answers to \qHow{}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  These ideas, fairly intuitive.

  Most of the work in this document amounts to ensuring this intuitive has a corresponding argument, and does not rest on specific cases.

  In particular, \fc{1} to ensure we do not over-generate \ros{0}.

  Though, these ideas fail to include plausible cases.

  For example, translation.
  If an agent is translating a phrase from one language to another, possible event in which the agent provides a different translation.
  Agent understands the semantic content of the phrase.

  However, \autopageref{scen:jojo} (\autopageref{scen:jojo}) highlighted the way our definition of a \fc{0} does not capture translations.
  For, if multiple translations are possible, it is plausible there is nothing which favours any particular translation.
