\begin{note}[Misleading is okay most of the time]
  Indeed, Misleading support is not, in general, a problem.
  Roll a die, claim support for bias, misleading --- and clear that it may be misleading, but fine.
  Or, director's previous films to claim support that one will find the new film enjoyable.
  Support is not conclusive.

  Following, moving to value given support is not problematic.

  Note looks genuine, purchase item.

\begin{note}[Explanation of \nI{}]
  With some illustrations in hand, we now turn to sketching an argument for \nI{}.

  Two conditions.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Support claimed for \(\phi\), which may be misleading.
  \item Information that implies support claimed for \(\phi\) is misleading if \(\psi\) does not have some value.
  \end{enumerate}
  Goal is to show that agent is not in a position to claim support for \(\psi\) by using implication.
  In other words, no claiming support for \(\phi\) because support for \(\phi\) would be misleading if \(\psi\) were not the case.

  Observations:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item No claim about \(\psi\) without appealing to \(\phi\) having value.
  \item As misleading,
  \end{enumerate}

  Using information only.
  So, required to get antecedent.
  Antecedent is that support claimed for \(\phi\) is not misleading.
  Hence, that \(\phi\) has the value indicated by the support claimed for \(\phi\).
  For, if agent does not, then \(\phi\) may be misleading, and then no basis for \(\psi\).

  So, requirement that \(\phi\) have value.
  Move from claiming support for \(\phi\) to holding that \(\phi\) has value.
  For, if no claim about \(\phi\) having value, then no claim about support not being misleading.

  These two things are different.
  May wish to observe here that the agent isn't in a position to move to the stronger claim.
  However, difficult\dots
  View this as something that may be discharged.

  Then, obtain that \(\psi\) has value.
  This is difficult, but I think correct.
  For, agent has moved to \(\phi\) having value, and hence is not appealing to support claimed.
  So, implausible that the agent is in a position to claim support for \(\psi\) prior to holding that \(\psi\) has value.
  From \(\phi\) having value to \(\psi\) having value.

  The question is whether there is a way to discharge additional claim about \(\phi\).

  For example, with \(BK\phi\), then this seems plausible, because have seen that \(\phi\) follows given belief.

  {Visual representation is having these two things leading to \(\psi\)}
  Circularity?
  In order to get stronger claim, need \(\psi\) to be the case, but without stronger claim, no getting that \(\psi\) is the case.
  In other words, prevent discharging because then lose the okayness of the initial transition.

  I.e.\ the point is not simply that the agent isn't in a position for stronger claim, but that without stronger claim there's no other way for the agent to get to \(\psi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Clarifying]
  Why first part isn't sufficient by itself.
  May be the case that agent gets some information about extending.
  Plausible that other agent knowledge is like this.
  Support claimed that some other agent knows that \(p\) doesn't really help with \(p\).
  However, given that they know, factivity means that one is in a position to claim support for \(p\) being the case.

  What the second part adds is that there's no equivalent explanation in the instances described.

  So, it's the combination of these two things.
  Support isn't strong enough to do anything more robust, and no account of why \(\psi\) without being more robust.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Expand on examples]
  Return to Rolex.
  Support claim for watch being genuine.
  From weaker, \nagent{1} doesn't have sufficiently strong support.
  Hence, no claim to support for jewellery shop.
  How does this show anything about the store?
  Haven't stated that the acquaintance purchased from the shop, nor that within time frame.
  There's nothing from the watch genuine to jewellery apart from information about mistaken.

  Go for pragmatics, but then agent doesn't need misleading premise, it's different information.
  Like gallery case, something else.

  In turn, then, replying on \(\psi\) having value in order to claim support for \(\psi\).
  Support claimed for \(\psi\) is in part that \(\psi\) has value.

  This is a problem.
  Value prior to claim of support to value.

  Trace back to where agent goes beyond support claimed.
  Distinction between appealing to support and appealing to having value.
  Agent steps beyond support.
  \(\psi\) results from this.
  Hence, \(\psi\) isn't obtained from support for \(\phi\) plus information.

  This, then, applies quite generally, there's always going to be a problem when moving from support claimed to proposition having value.

  This is fairly restricted, as relies on not misleading to `force' interest in value.

  Clearer example may be variant of transmission failure.
  So, simple knowledge, zebra or whatever.
  Visual perception, zebra, not donkey, etc.
  Change so that conditions are a little rough, and eye sight is to some extent at issue.
  This would be an instance.
  Possible that support claimed for perception in good conditions is different --- some new information would be required to find issue with sight.
  Or, may extends to resist alternatives, the agent needn't go through how things are.
  \nI{} does not clearly extend to such cases.
