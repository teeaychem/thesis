\begin{note}
  \dots and positive answers to \qzS{}.
\end{note}

\section{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}

\begin{note}
  Idea is to transform this into a chapter on \fc{}.
  Motivate \fc{} by focusing on problem \requ{1} place on appealing to any `fact' in order to provide a positive answer to \qzS{}.
  This isn't recursive, it's just a clear failure.
  Further, this motivates an understanding \emph{without} relying on the reader to grant a negative answer to the main issue.
  The puzzle doesn't arise \emph{only} because of a commitment to positive answers o \qzS{} when the agent has not witnessed the reasoning.

  \emph{However}, caution.
  For, as we have seen with testimony, it may be the case that status of a premises blocks a \requ{}.
  And, the argument given relies on the existence of a \requ{}.
  So, it may be the case that past reasoning blocks a \requ{}.
  Still, here, only need to deny this.
  Not saying that in every case agent's present reasoning is given priority.
  (Indeed, consider cases of being somewhat impaired, e.g., via exhaustion.
  Indeed, exhaustion is interesting.
  Basic consistency checks.
  Should be the case that conclude A, but just concluded \emph{not}-A, or something like this\dots)
  Rather, denying that past continues to secure in all instances.
  So, just need the potential to revise perspective on any previous conclusion.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Past conclusions and positive answers]
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{If} positive answer due to some past conclusion \emph{then} possible for the agent to conclude.
  \end{itemize}
  This conditional is immediate, because \qzS{} is about whether the agent would conclude, given that they have the option.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{If} possible to conclude, \emph{then} fact is insufficient.
  \end{itemize}
  This conditional is also immediate, because if the agent failed to conclude, then the fact that they had concluded wouldn't go anywhere.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The important constraint here is that past conclusion is providing a positive answer.

  Apparent counterexample. (Or maybe useful \illu{}?)

  Exhaustion.
  Some conclusion.
  Notice a \requ{}.
  Have concluded before.
  So, reason about the \requ{}.
  Fail to conclude.
  But, this doesn't highlight anything about previous conclusion.

  However, this is not right.
  It does show that previous conclusion does not function as a positive answer.
  It doesn't show there is a problem with the previous conclusion, but it does show that there is a problem with the role of this as an answer.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, given the above, a further question is whether something has the status of a \requ{} if the agent has previously concluded.

  Surely.

  For, else, always defer to the past.
  No correcting mistakes.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, the way in which past reasoning relates is by ensuring that the agent would reach the same conclusion.
  About the agent's reasoning.
  \emph{How} rather than \emph{that}.

  Look, what we are getting is that the agent would conclude.
  If something were to happen, then some action would be performed.
  There's no distinction between the answer and performing the act, roughly.
  Or, better put, the answer \emph{is about present reasoning}.
  Answer states that in present reasoning, would not fail.

  In this respect, \fc{}.

  Perhaps obvious, this is what the question asks.
  But, very important.
  Characterisation of the answer in terms of something forward looking.
  \fc{}.
  It is about the agent's present epistemic state, and in particular what the agent's present epistemic state is capable of.

  In other words, ability.
  What answers is ability, in the sense that ability iff would.

  This is very important to the understanding of \fc{}.

  And, I kind of want to have ability as a gloss, while focusing on \fc{} to avoid going into ability in too much detail.

  So, positive answer, then it's the pairing \emph{being} a \fc{}.
  (I should always use this instance of the copula.)
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  An interesting observation here is that in certain this all arises, to a certain extent, because of general abilities.
  General ability spans multiple different proposition-value-premises pairings.
  Hence, all of these function as \requ{1}, so long as the agent has the option.
\end{note}


\section{Outline}

\begin{note}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Idea of a \fc{}.
    Two reasons focus is on \fc{}.
    First, neutral on what it is that makes something a \fc{}.
    Second, keeps relation to \qzS{} clear.
  \item
    \fc{} only if support.
    This is a difficult point.
    The problem is there is room to resist.
  \item
    Positive answer \emph{only if} \fc{} or conclude at the same time.
    Here, use the squeezing argument.
    Some X such that X answers but X does not ensure pair is a \fc{}.
  \item
    Corollaries, concluding.
    In particular, have not relied on unwitnessed.
  \item
    Answers to why.
    Here, \requ{1}.
    Still, expand to non-witnessing cases.
  \item
    General and specific abilities.
  \item
    Answers to why, then.
    Note, here, that opportunity is interesting.
    The whole conjunction of all instance of the general ability is plausibly not a \requ{}.
    However, all that's needed is the \emph{individual} instances, and for these to raise a problem.
  \item
    The point is, \requ{1} for any general ability, and these are also \requ{1} for main pairing.
    (%
    Note --- or perhaps emphasise --- here, that the problem is \emph{not} recursive.
    Instead, the problem is about the spread.%
    )
  \item
    Here, then, ability is both the problem and the answer.
    What's interesting is the way in which ability functions.
    It's not merely \emph{that} the agent has the ability.
    Instead, it \emph{is} the ability.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Somewhere at the end, or perhaps on a speculative chapter:
  Deduction theorem for reasoning.
  And, support, so why not conclude from without witnessing the reasoning.
  This would just be witnessing a foregone-conclusion.
\end{note}

\section{Fragments}

\begin{note}
  A \fc{} is not something which functions as a premise.
  This is a category mistake.

  So, answer to \qzS{} can't be a premise, because, in principle, for any premise, if we have a \requ{}, then any premise which states that the \requ{} is satisfied is subject to the \requ{}.

  I mean, do I get an infinite regress here?
  Even if I do, I don't think it's important.
  The point is, even granting that the agent is correct, hum.
  The \requ{} remains, but that is true in both cases.
  The task isn't getting rid of the \requ{}.
  Rather, the task is to show that the agent would conclude.
  But, now, fails to answer, because think!

  \fc{} answers by pointing to the reasoning.
  Alternative answers by not doing so.
  As you have not pointed to the reasoning, it remains the case that whatever this is, the \requ{} applies.

  This is probably a better way of doing things.
  I have a clearer understanding of pointing to the reasoning.
  And, with respect to the reasoning, it's clear.
  There's no question about whether the agent would conclude, that is what the agent is pointing to.
  The only question is whether there really is such an event.

  By contrast, if we're not pointing to the reasoning, then\dots
  Whatever it is the agent is pointing to, the agent has the option of appealing to this regardless of whether there is a witnessing event.
  Hence, if there is no witnessing event, then useless???

  \emph{The same \requ{} applies}
  Because, failure to conclude, then this thing is useless.

  This is quite subtle.
  The point is, potential witnessing event.
  Without this, without this doing the work, whatever one thinks of, the same question still applies.
  (No recursion!)

  If one does appeal to the potential witnessing event, then one is pointing to the very thing that matters.

  Now, failure to conclude, then something has gone wrong.
  Yes.
  The key observation is that in the failure case, the alternative thing, whatever this happens to be, persists, or at least may persist.
  It's independent of there being a potential witnessing event.

  This is what shows it doesn't work.

  So, looking.
  If mistake, then bad things all around.

  If not a mistake, then still a problem.
  For, independence of potential witnessing event.
  Therefore, failure would prevent from doing work.

  Thing is, right about potential, done.
  Right about alternative, then still a question regarding the potential.
\end{note}

\section{Positive answers to \qzS{}}
\label{sec:positive-answers-qzs}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:PWEs}
    For an agent \vAgent{}, when concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[\emph{If}]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
      \item
        \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of \vAgent{} concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{then}]
      For any thing \(\qzSaV{}\):
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., resume]
      \item
        \(\qzSaV{}\) is a positive answer to \qzS{}.
      \item[\emph{only if}]
      \item
        From \vAgent{}' perspective, \(\qzSaV{}\) involves, in part, a potential event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{proposition}

  \autoref{prop:PWEs} is about answers to \qzS{}.
  Though, restricted.
  Answers only in the context of the existence of some \requ{}.
  And, only in terms of involvement from the agent's perspective.

  Not the case that \(\qzSaV{}\) and no potential witnessing event.
  %
  \footnote{
    Note, the embedded conditional states \(\qzSaV{}\) is a positive answer to \qzS{} \emph{only if} \(\qzSaV{}\) depends, in part, on potential event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).

    Converse is not the case.
    For example, suppose two \requ{1}.
    \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) and \(\pvp{\theta}{v''}{\Theta}\).
    A potential event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) (trivially) involves a potential event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
    However, such a potential event need not involve the agent concluding \(\pv{\theta}{v''}\) from \(\Theta\).
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In short, a category mistake.
  Some `fact' does not secure an action.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Obvious?]
  Suitably narrowed, \autoref{prop:PWEs} may be obvious.

  \qzS{} asks whether agent would conclude.
  Concluding is an event.
  Whether there is the potential for some event.
  Depends, whatever the answer is as a whole, need this.

  And, roughly, the argument for~\autoref{prop:PWEs} reduces to just this observation.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Argument for~\autoref{prop:PWEs}]
  \begin{argument}
    Suppose independence.
    Then, focusing only on \(X\), we have the possibility of \(X\) and there not being a potential witnessing event.
    So, we then have \(X\) and failure to conclude.
    But, then, \requ{} still.
    Because, everything is as it was, but the agent has not concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).

      {
        \color{red}
        Note!
        The key point here is what is compatible with \(X\) being an answer.
        From the agent's point of view, failure to conclude (probably) isn't a live possibility.
        Else, there's going to be a problem, as \qzS{} is basically requiring that this is not a live possibility.
        However, whether \(X\) functions as an answer is a separate issue from what holds from the agent's point of view.

        The point is that \(X\), being independent, does not do enough to rule out possibility.
      }
      {
        \color{blue}
        So, this leads to a possible objection.
        The only relevant questions to ask are in terms of proposition-value pairs, or something like this.
        I don't think this works, given all the examples, but it's an option.
      }
      {
        \color{green}
        So, another way to do this:
        Construct so that the answer has not yet been given.
        Now, we have \(\Phi\).
        Problem is, adding anything to \(\Phi\), there question still remains.
        For, failure would dead-end anything added.

        In \emph{this} presentation, parallel to \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj}.
      }
    \end{argument}

  On the one hand, this seems obvious.
  \qzS{} is just a question about whether the agent would conclude.
  Hence, question about whether there is some potential witnessing event.

  On the other hand, surprising.

  \begin{corollary}
    Positive answer to \qzS{} not a proposition-value pair.
  \end{corollary}
  Of course, proposition capturing.
  Key distinction is in terms of how the agent relates.
  With proposition-value pair, valuation.

  Here, the valuation makes the difference.
  How this comes about.
  Distinct from whether the state of affairs holds up.

  Important, this is still from the agent's perspective.
  So, there's no guarantee that there really is a potential witnessing event.%
  \footnote{
    This works even with reduction to knowledge that, as there's no guarantee that the agent really has the knowledge (that).
  }
  What we get is the way in which \qzS{} receives a positive answer from the agent's perspective, and that is, in part, in terms of potential witnessing event, or something that depends on such an event.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  To illustrate, that the agent has concluded \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) by witnessing reasoning from \(\Psi\) to \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is irrelevant.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{corollary}
    Positive answer involves something which is not a premise.
  \end{corollary}

  This holds, given our understanding of concluding.
  However, this isn't too interesting.
  Relevant assumption motivated from simplicity.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, idea of a \fc{}.
\end{note}

\subsection{Objections to the argument}
\label{sec:objections-argument}

\begin{note}
  Argument relies two things.
  First, apparent factivity.
  Second, content of \qzS{} relating to event.

  I don't see a way around this.
  However, two possible avenues.
  Deny either of these two things.
  Attempt plausible motivation for both, but show how the motivation fails to move.

  Following, a more interesting chance for failure.
  Does raise problems, but not for this argument.
\end{note}

\subsection{A shortcoming}
\label{sec:shortcoming}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  Need to shift.
  This isn't really about positive answers to \qzS{}.
  Rather, this is about how \qzS{} relates to why.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Argument relies on tying content to explanation.

  In this respect, there is room for an objection.
  Deviant causal chains.
  Point here is that there are cases where these come apart.

  This isn't only a problem for causal theories of reasoning.
  The point is, some instantiation, and so long as act may be caused by something else, then possibly caused by the instantiation.

  So, possible here.

  Well, hold on.
  What is need is the relevance of the content.
  For this objection to work, need to take a theoretical perspective.
  See, in Davidson's case, the idea is fusing these two things together.
  We answer two different questions with a common thing viewed in two ways.

  Still, I think the objection can be pressed.
  Only \emph{really} an explanation is no deviance.

  I think this makes sense, or at least makes enough sense.
  Answers to `why', on this understanding, are tentative.

  Or, rest on presupposition that agent performed the action.

  So, contingent on showing there is no causal deviance.

  This is different to error.
  With error, thing appealed to isn't the case, but appeal still did work.
  Here, it doesn't matter whether or not the case, no work is done.

  In contrast to more typical instances of the problem, don't need to rule out deviant causal chains.
  Instead, just need one instance to fail to hold.
  One instance of non-deviousness.

  Still a problem for a compatible account which avoids.
  For, here, there can't be any direct link from perspective to reason.

  For example, \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa}

    \begin{quote}
      [W]e explain an event that is an action done for reasons by appealing to the fact that the agent took certain considerations to settle the question of whether to act in some way, therein intended so to act, and successfully executed that intention in action.
    [\emph{T}]\emph{his} complex fact, [\dots] is the reason that rationalizes the action---that explains the action by giving the agent’s reason for acting.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[431]{Hieronymi:2011aa})}
  \end{quote}

  So, here, considerations which settle question, and in so settling question.
  Link between settling the question and acting.

  Following \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa}, no room for deviance.
  Too tight.

  In other words, so long as this fact holds, there is no distinction between settling the question and acting.
  Therefore, no deviance.

  Compatible, I think.
  Question is whether in resolving \qzS{} is sufficiently tied to resolving the question \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa} identifies.
  And, plausibly is.
  This is what the motivation for \qzS{} did.

  Trouble is, for our purposes, need at least sufficient conditions for when this complex fact obtains.
  And, no account of this.

  \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa} notes the gaps.

  Some tension.
  These considerations aren't premises.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Shortly consider a handful of potential objections, which I will argue fail.

  However, there is one objection to which I have no response.
\end{note}

\subsection{Issues}
\label{sec:issues}

\begin{note}
  Something wrong.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Other questions}
\label{sec:other-questions}

\nocite{Smith:1988aa,Smith:1987tz}

\begin{note}
  Similar question:
  Why did the food taste salty.
  Answer, too much salt.
  What answers is, in part, excess salt.

  By assumption, there is no external world, no food, and no excess salt.
  But, from agent's perspective.

  What happened, what was the case.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Put an explicit proposition-value pair in the question.
  Why is it true that the food tasted salty.
  It is true that there was too much salt.

  Still, in part, circumstances.
  True.
  Interpreted.

  No account of true without the circumstances having a role.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Why early for meeting.
  Not because clock.
  Rather, because time.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Any other variation without interpreting, don't get a good answer to the question.
\end{note}

\paragraph{No getting carried away}

\begin{note}
  Doesn't hold for all questions.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Different values]
  Desire, then something else, likely.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Mental states]
  Question about why believed, after finding belief is mistaken.
\end{note}

\subsection{Rationalisations}
\label{sec:rationalisations}

\begin{note}
  Understanding of `why'.

  Why, from the agent's perspective.

  But, this doesn't entail anything.
  Doesn't follow there is a potential witnessing event.

  Only have something psychological.

  So, whether there is a relation of support is dispensable.

  So, contents is not part of the explanation why from our perspective.
  This is what \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa} terms `Dancy's gap'.
  Worry here is whether we have a clear account of why.
  For, whether the content holds isn't clearly relevant.

  As I understand the gap, issue in terms of our answers to why.
  In some cases, the agent's perspective, and in other cases more than this.

  Or, another way of putting thing, in some cases the agent's perspective is only part.

  Different perspective, even the agent.

  Now, the problem.
  Agent recognises from their perspective.

  So, the idea is, only psychological facts matter.
  Agent recognises this.
  Then, this breaks down the role of the content.
  So, there's no easy movement from content to account of why from agent's perspective.
  For, there's no clear factive presence from the agent's point of view.

  But, this can't work.
  Still matters that the agent thinks.
  And, if non-factive, then no positive answer.

  Push this gap from our perspective, and raise an issue about whether there is anything beyond agent's perspective.
  But, this fails when internalised, at least for positive answers.

  Still, question is irrelevant.
  But, the issue here is that we're talking about mental states.
  It's concluding.

  There's no way to ask this question.
  For, then the question is independent of whether the agent would conclude.
  What the agent would do with other proposition value pairs.
  But, if all that matters is what's going on in the present, this fails.

  Only understand this in terms of our perspective, and then, because reasoning, there's no pressing issue.

  But, I don't think this is relevant.
  For, what we are interested in accounting for is concluding.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Deviant causal chains}
\label{sec:devi-caus-chains}

\begin{note}
  So, the other option is to embrace deviant causal chains.
  Have the content, but this doesn't work in the way the agent thinks it does.

  Example from Davidson.

  The trouble here is that the content and resulting action match.
  So, things make sense from the agent's point of view.

  Deviant, but maybe not so deviant here.

  Systematic deviance, where content is separated from role of mental state.

  But, I see no motivation for this.

  Solution to causal chains doesn't get round this, because the result is a restricted account.
  So, there's no guaranteed trade-off here.
  Trouble is, it seems hard to see a case where this wouldn't be the case.

  
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Mistakes and vats}

\begin{note}
  Well, it's possible that the agent is wrong.
  This is fine, from the agent's perspective.
\end{note}


\subsubsection{Answers which are not proposition-value pairs, in part}
\label{sec:answers-which-are}

\begin{note}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Somewhat simple.
  \item
    Is there a flaw?
  \item
    Well, point is there's something that isn't a proposition-value pair.
  \item
    Parallel?
  \item
    Knowledge how and knowledge that.
  \item
    Same argument applies to dispute, in a fairly straightforward way.
    Specifically, regarding knowledge that, regardless of knowledge how.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Sketch of the argument.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Potential witnessing event in which agent concludes.
  \item
    \label{pwe-iff-kh}
    This is the case if and only if knows how to conclude (if not knowledge, then insufficient grasp on witnessing event).
  \item
    \label{kw-is-kt}
    Knowledge how is a species of knowledge that.
  \item
    Knowledge that \(\varphi\)
  \item
    Knowledge that \(\varphi\) does not involve event.
  \item
    Equivalent.
  \item
    So, at least possible to answer with something that does not involve event.
  \end{enumerate}

  So, replacement.

  Limitation is option to replace.

  Still, this is enough to highlight a flaw in \autoref{prop:PWEs}.

  In addition, given that agent is not literally answering the question, additional argument that this is how to understand.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \dots In outline, depends on how the details are filled in.

  \autoref{pwe-iff-kh} and \autoref{kw-is-kt} in particular.

  Grant \autoref{pwe-iff-kh}, explore \autoref{kw-is-kt}.

  Not just strong intellectualism, but\dots

  Knowing that is not,~\cite{Stalnaker:2012tp} `justiﬁed true belief, painted over with a Gettier-proof coating of some kind.' (\citeyear[754]{Stalnaker:2012tp})

  Instead, ~\citeauthor{Stanley:2011ut} (and~\citeauthor{Stalnaker:2012tp}'s) views are compatible with knowing that involving, at least in part, a potential witnessing event.
  Sparing the details, characterisation by~\citeauthor{Weatherson:2017tb}:%

\begin{note}
  Optional section.

  Here, look to the literature to see what is identified in \autoref{prop:PWEs} isn't so bad.

\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, with \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj}, we get a rule of inference, great.

  \citeauthor{Wieland:2013vf} characterises the general understanding of \textcite{Carroll:1895uj} in terms of two lessons:
  \begin{quote}
    [T]he negative lesson is that if you add ever more premises to an argument \dots, then you will never demonstrate that its conclusion follows logically.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[984]{Wieland:2013vf})}
  \end{quote}

  Parallel, static answers, still option for concluding otherwise.

  \begin{quote}
    [T]he positive lesson is that rules of inference, rather than premises of the form `if premises such and such are true, then the conclusion is true', will do the job.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[984]{Wieland:2013vf})}
  \end{quote}

  Parallel, the dynamic status of a rule.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Similar, but a little different.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  No regress.

  Following \citeauthor{Wieland:2013vf}:

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item[IR]
      For any item x of a certain type, S \(\varphi\)-s x only if
      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),noitemsep]
      \item
        there is a new item y of that same type, and
      \item
        S \(\varphi\)-s y.%
        \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[996]{Wieland:2013vf})}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{quote}

  Now, concluding, versus would conclude.
  However, focus is before concluding.
  So, would conclude and would conclude.

  Difficulty is, it's not at all clear this is the case.
  Need to be sure that there is a \requ{} for any \requ{}.
  Yet, from agent's perspective.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Interesting thing here is that it's not `just' the rule.

  \emph{And}, important difference is that the agent isn't moving from premises to conclusion.
  Following the standard interpretation, \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} gets us that there's a rule in play when agent concludes.
  (Or, more strictly, modus ponens\dots)
  But, this is very different from something similar being active when drawing some other conclusion.

  So, there is a link to \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj}, but it is somewhat indirect.
  Still, this should soften the conclusion.

  In short, with \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} it's the rule.
  Here, it's the ability to employ the rule.
\end{note}


\subsubsection{Dispositions}
\label{sec:dispositions}

\begin{note}[Parallel between dispositions and ability]
  Consider \citeauthor{Choi:2021wg}'s characterisation of the Simple Conditional Analysis of dispositions:
  \begin{quote}
    An object is disposed to \emph{M} when \emph{C} iff it would \emph{M} if it were the case that \emph{C}.\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear{Choi:2021wg})}
  \end{quote}
  For example, an object is disposed to dissolve when it is placed in water iff the object would dissolve if it were the case that it is placed in water.

  The Simple Conditional Analysis may be challenged, but for our purposes it is adequate.
  We are interested in the broad form of the truth condition, and various more refined analyses share the same broad form.
  Note, in particular, that it being the case that \emph{C} and \emph{M} happening describes an event.
  Given appropriate conditions; salt dissolves, glass breaks, and I mumble when I am tired.
  The key idea is that the property of being disposed to \emph{M} when \emph{C} is analysed in terms of the (possible) event of \emph{M} happening when \emph{C}.

  The parallel to ability is established by noting that ability may also be analysed in terms of a (possible) event, as we have seen.
  In particular, by incorporating volition in the analysans of the Simple Conditional Analysis.
  To illustrate, \citeauthor{Mandelkern:2017aa} trace the Conditional Analysis of ability  to \textcite{Hume:1748tp} and \textcite{Moore:1912te}, among others:
  \begin{quote}
    S can \(\phi\) iff S would \(\phi\) if S tried to \(\phi\)\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[Cf.][308]{Mandelkern:2017aa})}
  \end{quote}
  Compare to the Simple Conditional Analysis of dispositions:
  The object is some agent \emph{S}, \emph{C} is `S tried to \(\phi\)' and \emph{M} is `S \(\phi\)s' --- it is volition alone which distinguishes the analyses.
  For example, I have the ability to demonstrate that a rectangle with dimensions \(19\text{cm}\) by \(7\text{cm}\) has area \(133\text{cm}^{2}\) only if I would demonstrate that a rectangle with dimensions \(19\text{cm}\) by \(7\text{cm}\) has area \(133\text{cm}^{2}\) if it were the case that I tried that a rectangle with dimensions \(19\text{cm}\) by \(7\text{cm}\) has area \(133\text{cm}^{2}\).
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Doxastic justification}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:dox-just}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Turri:2010aa}

  \begin{quote}
    Necessarily, for all S, \emph{p}, and \emph{t}, if \emph{p} is propositionally justified for S at \emph{t}, then \emph{p} is propositionally justified for S at \emph{t} because S currently possesses at least one means of coming to believe \emph{p} such that, were S to believe \emph{p} in one of those ways, S's belief would thereby be doxastically justified.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[316]{Turri:2010aa})}
  \end{quote}

  Key is that doxastic justification depends on what the agent does.

  \citeauthor{Turri:2010aa}'s focus is on how reasons are used.
  What the agent does.

  Seen with example.

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(P\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item
      The Spurs will win if they play the Pistons.
    \item
      The Spurs will play the Pistons.
    \end{enumerate}

    \mbox{}\hfill\(\vdots\)\hfill\mbox{}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(P\arabic*), resume]
    \item
      Therefore, the Spurs will win.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[317]{Turri:2010aa})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  Rather than \emph{modus ponens}, `\emph{modus profusus}'.
  Conclude \(r\) from \(p\) and \(q\).
  (\citeyear[317]{Turri:2010aa})

  \begin{quote}
    The way in which the subject performs, the manner in which she makes use of her reasons, fundamentally determines whether her belief is doxastically justified.
    Poor utilization of even the best reasons for believing \emph{p} will prevent you from justifiedly believing or knowing that \emph{p}.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[316]{Turri:2010aa})}
  \end{quote}

  Variant of ~\cite{Prior:1960wh}'s `tonk' connective.
  Though, difference is between connective and rule.
  \(p\) tonk \(q\) would not be propositionally justified.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Turri:2010aa} is similar to \citeauthor{Goldman:1979ui}

  Begin with justification.

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{10}
    \item
      Person \emph{S} is \emph{ex ante} justified in believing \emph{p} at \emph{t} if and only if there is a reliable belief-forming operation available to \emph{S} which is such that if \emph{S} applied that operation to this total cognitive state at \emph{t}, \emph{S} would believe \emph{p} at \emph{t}-plus-delta (for a suitably small delta) and that belief would be \emph{ex post} justified.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  Where, sufficient condition for belief would be \emph{ex post} justified:
  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item
      If S's believing \emph{p} at \emph{t} results from a reliable cognitive belief-forming process (or set of processes), then S's belief in \emph{p} at \emph{t} is justified.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[13]{Goldman:1979ui})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}
  Roughly, at least.
  \citeauthor{Goldman:1979ui} refines this a fair bit, but this isn't important.

  Availability of a reliable belief-forming operation!

  Relation here is brittle.
  Account of justification, apply to concluding.
  Well, then all we get is that before concluding, would make sense to conclude only if available.
  Running something like the \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} regress, not some state.
  But, this only tells us about suitability to conclude.

  Still, key point is process.

  Another useful thing to highlight is the suitably small delta.
  With \requ{}, this is captured in terms of the option.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Significant difference is in the case of justification, we're not interested in the agent's perspective.
  Hence, these accounts are understood in terms of the agent having the ability, roughly.

  With \qzS{}, we're interested in the agent's perspective, and there is no guarantee that the agent really has the ability.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Ryle}

\begin{note}
  Ideas regarding \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s distinction between knowing \emph{how} and knowing \emph{that} (Cf.~\citeyear{Ryle:1946tu}).

  Now, I confess my understanding of \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s distinction is limited --- I have not taken whatever opportunities I have had to read through \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s work.%
  \footnote{
    Though, I understand enough from passing commentary to note that the idea \emph{I} am perusing here does not, strictly, require that knowledge how and knowledge that are distinct kinds of knowledge.
    (See~\textcite{Pavese:2022up} for more!)
  }

  Following analogy from~\textcite{Ryle:2009us}:

  \begin{quote}
    Knowing `\emph{if p, then q}' is, \dots rather like being in possession of a railway ticket.
    It is having a licence or warrant to make a journey from London to Oxford.
    (Knowing a variable hypothetical or `law' is like having a season ticket.)
    As a person can have a ticket without actually travelling with it and without ever being in London or getting to Oxford, so a person can have an inference warrant without actually making any inferences and even without ever acquiring the premisses from which to make them.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[250]{Ryle:2009us})}
  \end{quote}

  Continuing~\citeauthor{Ryle:2009us}'s analogy, in the case of positive answers to \qzS{}:
  What matters is that the agent is currently in possession of the (season) ticket.

  Even if current possession of the (season) ticket is knowledge that, it is present knowledge.
  And, present without being applied.
\end{note}

\section{\fc{3}}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:fc}

\begin{note}
  \begin{definition}
    \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} and \qzS{} has positive answer, \emph{if and only if} \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \fc{}
  \end{definition}
  So, here, define positive answers in terms of \fc{}.

  Then, develop some understanding of how a \fc{} answers.
  Though, I don't think this is the way to go.
  There's nothing informative about this definition.
  What I really want is an only if condition, stating what it is that's interesting about a \fc{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Positive answers to \qzS{}.

  Here, the task is to emphasise what it involved in \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) being a \fc{}.
  The point is that \fc{} needs to capture that \fc{} are `active' rather than `passive'.
\end{note}


\begin{note}[Foregone-conclusions]
  Basic idea of a foregone-conclusion.

  \begin{restatable}[Foregone-conclusions]{definition}{definitionForegoneC}
    For any proposition-value-premises pairing \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) is a \emph{\fc{0}} from some pool of premises \(\Phi\)
    \end{itemize}
    \emph{If and only if}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There is a potential event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

      Given the agent's present epistemic, the agent would not fail to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) were the agent to reason.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{restatable}

  {
    Potential event doesn't say much.
    What is does clarify is the dynamic nature.

    And, the point is that past reasoning does not entail there is a potential event, in general.
    Past reasoning only entails there was some event.

    So, the key point for the argument given is that past reasoning does not entail.
    If it did, then we wouldn't have a \requ{}.
    Well, hold on.
    I'm a little confused.
    The point is, if the agent were to fail to conclude, the past reasoning wouldn't be of any use.
    So, the fact alone doesn't provide the entailment.
  }

  Whether foregone-conclusion takes agent's present epistemic state as a function.
  However, does not need to be the case that the agent recognises foregone-conclusion.

  At most, witnessing provides information about method.

  For any property \(P\) which would follow from any instance of witnessing reasoning \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), the agent's present epistemic state is sufficient to determine \(P\) without witnessing reasoning from \(\Phi\) to \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).

  Suppose \(P\) follows from concluding.
  Forgegone-conclusion.
  So, agent's present epistemic state, agent would not fail.
  However, it then follows that \(P\).

  Here, restricted \(P\) to follow from any.
  Hence, if there are multiple methods, \(P\) may be restricted.

  However, broaden.
\end{note}


\section{\fc{3} and support}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:fc3-support}

\begin{note}
  This is where things get somewhat difficult.

  This is something we need to argue for.

  The term is suggestive, `conclusion', and concluded only if support.
  However, the agent has not concluded, so assumption doesn't do any work.%
  \footnote{
    Variant of this argument in which argue that the agent concludes.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}
    For any path, present epistemic state determines availability of path.
  \end{proposition}

  Start.
  Then, continue.
  Started from \(\Phi\), so will conclude.
  Hence, no matter choice made, must have taken the possibility of this choice into account.
  So, it must be the case that determined.

  Hence, if witness, then via some path.

  So, witnessing predetermined path.
  Any instances of concluding by witnessing reduces to witnessing predetermined path.

  Witnessing may provide information about path, but witnessing doesn't 


  For any X from W,
  present determines whether or not X from agent's point of view, then forgone conclusion.

  In other words, agent's present epistemic state determines.
  Agent may need to witness to figure out how determined, but witnessing does not influence.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Two worries]
  Two worries.

  First, that even though \fc{0}, the agent would not conclude.
  Either because \(\Phi\) is unavailable, or because no potential witnessing event.
  So, can't remove \fc{0} from account of why.

  However, then \fc{0} does not support.

  If grant that \fc{0} supports, then this seems to work out.
  Further, if require existence, then things that support get very messy.
  Dopeganger cases.
  Reason is I saw A, but it wasn't A, appealing to something that doesn't exist.
  Various other cases like this.

  Difference.
  In these cases, have premise, thing is that the truth value is distinct.
  Here, possibly no premise.

  Well, this is different.
  However, I don't think this is sufficient to reject the idea.
  Just because this distinction doesn't arise in the case of witnessing doesn't really do much.

  Look, a `bad' premise offers no more support for the agent than no premise.

  Second, need \emph{that} \fc{0}.
  However, the point is that this is about the agent's present epistemic state.
  \emph{Without} \fc{0}, the agent would reason.
  This is just the key point reiterated.
  Know whether, \fc{0} just adds information about which.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Knowing whether}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  There is scope for an objection here.
  Argued that answer to \qzS{} is not a proposition-value pair.
  But, knowing how.
  If strong intellectualism, then proposition-value pair answers to knowing how.
  And, apply the same to \qzS{}.

  For this to work, need, following terminology of \textcite{Glick:2011vd}, \emph{strong} intellectualism.

  But, this is also fine, no?
  Because, the point is that answering from the agent's perspective.
  Indeed, the same argument holds for knowledge from the agent's perspective.
  Regardless of what produces the answer, knowledge is factive.
  So, it's not only the mental state, but also the state of affairs.

  Contrast this with belief.
  Here, answering why believe.
  This is just a mental state, and is non-factive.
  So, don't need to involve a state of affairs in answer.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Intuitive cases]
  Knowing whether and knowing how to.
  More or less interchangeable.

  Know whether \(x + y = z\).
  Know how to calculate \(x + y\).
  Indeed, for any \(z\), know whether \(x + y = z\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  To \illu{0}, questions and answers.

  Do you know whether \(83\) is prime?

  Not off the top of my head.

  Do you know whether \(28 + 55 = 83\)?

  Sure, but give me a moment.

  Do you know whether \dots

  No.

  Of course, might hold that the agent needs to have figured things out.
  But, then we have a plausible reduction.
  Knowing whether, and witnessing whether.
  Common component.

  Now, idea is a little different, as knowledge implies factivity.
  Interest with concluding is that not necessarily factive.
  From the agent's perspective.

  `Determining whether'.
  Or, rather `\fc{0}'.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Relation here is tentative.

  ~\cite{Bengson:2011th}.
  \begin{quote}
    \emph{Pi}.
    Louis, a competent mathematician, knows how to find the n\(^{\text{th}}\) numeral, for any numeral \(n\), in the decimal expansion of \(\pi\).
    He knows the algorithm and knows how to apply it in a given case.
    However, because of principled computational limitations, Louis (like all ordinary human beings) is unable to find the \(10^{46}\) numeral in the decimal expansion of \(\pi\).%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[170]{Bengson:2011th})}
  \end{quote}

  Not clearly a \fc{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Understanding here.
  Intellectualist and anti-intellectualist views.

  Proposal fits well with anti-intellectualist such as~\citeauthor{Habgood-Coote:2019we}'s (\citeyear{Habgood-Coote:2019we}) Interrogative Capacity View.%
  \footnote{
    \begin{quote}
      \emph{The Interrogative Capacity View}.
      For any context c, subject S, and activity V, an utterance of `S knows how to V' (in its practical-knowledge ascribing sense) is true in c iff c has associated with it a set of practically relevant situations {F1, F2, \dots}, and, for all (or at least most) Fi that are members of {F1, F2, \dots}, S has the capacity to activate knowledge of a ﬁne-grained answer to the question, how to V in Fi?, in the process of V-ing.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[92]{Habgood-Coote:2019we})}
    \end{quote}
  }
  But, this is not the focus.
  
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Note, principle from~\cite{Barker:1975un} does not hold.
  for example, chess game.
  Know whether it is possible to win, and strong belief that it is not possible.
  Belief doesn't really mean anything.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \fc{2} is weaker.
  Knowing, factive.
  Though, plausible that these amount to the same thing in various cases.
  Either because \fc{} is determined by knowing how to.
  Or, because knowing is weakened to the agent's perspective.

  Sudoku puzzles.
  Know how to figure out.
  So, know whether any solution is valid.

  Of course, in certain cases, there are shortcuts.
  Two even numbers, then know whether by checking whether the last digit is even or odd.
  And, other cases, contingent shortcut, such as two of the same number in a square for Sudoku.

  So, really, knowing how to.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Trimming]
  \begin{proposition}
    Basically, there's no role for anything beyond \(\Phi\) in the case of a foregone-conclusion.

    \(\Phi\), in the context of the agent's present epistemic state is sufficient to secure the conclusion, and the possibility of witnessing reasoning.
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{proposition}
    Foregone-conclusion just in case \(\Phi\) supports \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
    \begin{argument}
      In short, given agent's present epistemic state, there's a guaranteed path from \(\Phi\) to \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
    \end{argument}
    In other words, if \(\Phi\) does not support \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), then \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is not a foregone-conclusion.
  \end{proposition}

  Now, as the agent has not witnessed reasoning, need information that \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a foregone-conclusion in order to recognise this.
  However, with information that \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a foregone-conclusion, the information has no role in supporting \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, that \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{0} provides information, and explains, in part or whole, \emph{how} the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
  However, \emph{why} is accounted for by \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\section{Foregone-concluding}

\begin{note}[Foregone-concluding]
  Pair this with a key idea.

  \begin{restatable}[Foregone-concluding]{idea}{ideaForegoneCing}
    \label{idea:reassignment}
    If foregone-conclusion, then may conclude.
    %\vspace{-\baselineskip}

  Cases where concluding by witnessing reduces to witnessing forgone conclusion.
  \emph{Concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) is just witnessing foregone-conclusion.}
  So, reduction, in certain cases.
  Further, if forgone conclusion, then conclude.
  At least, in certain cases.

\section{Interlude}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:interlude}

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{note}
  Important limitation here is that \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{}.

  This need not be the case.

  For example, consider discussion of~\autoref{illu:gist:calc}.
  Testimony.
  Failure of a \requ{}.

  It is possible that a prior conclusion of \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) prevents \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) being a \requ{}.

  However, in general, this is a bad response.
  For, this would result in discounting the agent's present epistemic state.

  No doubt, some conclusions are more secure that others.
  However, such a hierarchy is not temporal.
