\begin{note}
  \dots and positive answers to \qzS{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  It is not possible to reduce positive answers to \qzS{} to additional premises.

  Or, the content of a premise attitude.
\end{note}

\section{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}

\begin{note}
  Idea is to transform this into a chapter on \fc{}.
  Motivate \fc{} by focusing on problem \requ{1} place on appealing to any `fact' in order to provide a positive answer to \qzS{}.
  This isn't recursive, it's just a clear failure.
  Further, this motivates an understanding \emph{without} relying on the reader to grant a negative answer to the main issue.
  The puzzle doesn't arise \emph{only} because of a commitment to positive answers o \qzS{} when the agent has not witnessed the reasoning.

  \emph{However}, caution.
  For, as we have seen with testimony, it may be the case that status of a premises blocks a \requ{}.
  And, the argument given relies on the existence of a \requ{}.
  So, it may be the case that past reasoning blocks a \requ{}.
  Still, here, only need to deny this.
  Not saying that in every case agent's present reasoning is given priority.
  (Indeed, consider cases of being somewhat impaired, e.g., via exhaustion.
  Indeed, exhaustion is interesting.
  Basic consistency checks.
  Should be the case that conclude A, but just concluded \emph{not}-A, or something like this\dots)
  Rather, denying that past continues to secure in all instances.
  So, just need the potential to revise perspective on any previous conclusion.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Past conclusions and positive answers]
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{If} positive answer due to some past conclusion \emph{then} possible for the agent to conclude.
  \end{itemize}
  This conditional is immediate, because \qzS{} is about whether the agent would conclude, given that they have the option.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{If} possible to conclude, \emph{then} fact is insufficient.
  \end{itemize}
  This conditional is also immediate, because if the agent failed to conclude, then the fact that they had concluded wouldn't go anywhere.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The important constraint here is that past conclusion is providing a positive answer.

  Apparent counterexample. (Or maybe useful \illu{}?)

  Exhaustion.
  Some conclusion.
  Notice a \requ{}.
  Have concluded before.
  So, reason about the \requ{}.
  Fail to conclude.
  But, this doesn't highlight anything about previous conclusion.

  However, this is not right.
  It does show that previous conclusion does not function as a positive answer.
  It doesn't show there is a problem with the previous conclusion, but it does show that there is a problem with the role of this as an answer.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, given the above, a further question is whether something has the status of a \requ{} if the agent has previously concluded.

  Surely.

  For, else, always defer to the past.
  No correcting mistakes.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, the way in which past reasoning relates is by ensuring that the agent would reach the same conclusion.
  About the agent's reasoning.
  \emph{How} rather than \emph{that}.

  Look, what we are getting is that the agent would conclude.
  If something were to happen, then some action would be performed.
  There's no distinction between the answer and performing the act, roughly.
  Or, better put, the answer \emph{is about present reasoning}.
  Answer states that in present reasoning, would not fail.

  In this respect, \fc{}.

  Perhaps obvious, this is what the question asks.
  But, very important.
  Characterisation of the answer in terms of something forward looking.
  \fc{}.
  It is about the agent's present epistemic state, and in particular what the agent's present epistemic state is capable of.

  In other words, ability.
  What answers is ability, in the sense that ability iff would.

  This is very important to the understanding of \fc{}.

  And, I kind of want to have ability as a gloss, while focusing on \fc{} to avoid going into ability in too much detail.

  So, positive answer, then it's the pairing \emph{being} a \fc{}.
  (I should always use this instance of the copula.)
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Then, \fc{} only if support.
  And, \fc{} only if any other \requ{} are also \fc{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  An interesting observation here is that in certain this all arises, to a certain extent, because of general abilities.
  General ability spans multiple different proposition-value-premises pairings.
  Hence, all of these function as \requ{1}, so long as the agent has the option.
\end{note}


\section{Outline}

\begin{note}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Warming up?
    Here, focus on having concluded.
    This is probably helpful, as it covers the most important case in a concrete way.
    The difficulty is that it does not generalise.
    Hence, the more general argument.
    And, helps introduce the idea of a \fc{}.
  \item
    Idea of a \fc{}.
    Two reasons focus is on \fc{}.
    First, neutral on what it is that makes something a \fc{}.
    Second, keeps relation to \qzS{} clear.
  \item
    \fc{} only if support.
    This is a difficult point.
    The problem is there is room to resist.
  \item
    Positive answer \emph{only if} \fc{} or conclude at the same time.
    Here, use the squeezing argument.
    Some X such that X answers but X does not ensure pair is a \fc{}.
  \item
    Corollaries, concluding.
    In particular, have not relied on unwitnessed.
  \item
    Answers to why.
    Here, \requ{1}.
    Still, expand to non-witnessing cases.
  \item
    General and specific abilities.
  \item
    Answers to why, then.
    Note, here, that opportunity is interesting.
    The whole conjunction of all instance of the general ability is plausibly not a \requ{}.
    However, all that's needed is the \emph{individual} instances, and for these to raise a problem.
  \item
    The point is, \requ{1} for any general ability, and these are also \requ{1} for main pairing.
    (%
    Note --- or perhaps emphasise --- here, that the problem is \emph{not} recursive.
    Instead, the problem is about the spread.%
    )
  \item
    Here, then, ability is both the problem and the answer.
    What's interesting is the way in which ability functions.
    It's not merely \emph{that} the agent has the ability.
    Instead, it \emph{is} the ability.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Somewhere at the end, or perhaps on a speculative chapter:
  Deduction theorem for reasoning.
  And, support, so why not conclude from without witnessing the reasoning.
  This would just be witnessing a foregone-conclusion.
\end{note}

\section{Prior conclusions}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:prior-conclusions}

\begin{note}
  There are two things to distinguish here.
  First, that the agent has concluded.
  Second, the agent having concluded.
  Roughly.

  The thing is, I'm not arguing against the role of prior conclusions.
  Instead, I'm arguing against how they are applied.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}
    If \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{}, then prior conclusion does not answer \qzS{}.
  \end{proposition}

  Argument.
  Short, here, if failed to conclude, then would not conclude.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Fairly simple argument.

  Key is assumption that \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{}.
\end{note}

\section{\fc{3}}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:fc}

\begin{note}
  Positive answers to \qzS{}.

  Here, the task is to emphasise what it involved in \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) being a \fc{}.
  The point is that \fc{} needs to capture that \fc{} are `active' rather than `passive'.
\end{note}


\begin{note}[Foregone-conclusions]
  Basic idea of a foregone-conclusion.

  \begin{restatable}[Foregone-conclusions]{definition}{definitionForegoneC}
    For any proposition-value-premises pairing \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) is a \emph{\fc{0}} from some pool of premises \(\Phi\)
    \end{itemize}
    \emph{If and only if}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Given the agent's present epistemic, the agent would not fail to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) were the agent to reason.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{restatable}

  Whether foregone-conclusion takes agent's present epistemic state as a function.
  However, does not need to be the case that the agent recognises foregone-conclusion.

  At most, witnessing provides information about method.

  For any property \(P\) which would follow from any instance of witnessing reasoning \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), the agent's present epistemic state is sufficient to determine \(P\) without witnessing reasoning from \(\Phi\) to \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).

  Suppose \(P\) follows from concluding.
  Forgegone-conclusion.
  So, agent's present epistemic state, agent would not fail.
  However, it then follows that \(P\).

  Here, restricted \(P\) to follow from any.
  Hence, if there are multiple methods, \(P\) may be restricted.

  However, broaden.
\end{note}


\section{Interlude}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:interlude}

\subsection{Idea}

\begin{note}
  In short, a category mistake.
  Some `fact' does not secure an action.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}

  ~\cite{Besson:2018wz} in here somewhere. 
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Similar to \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj}.
  \begin{quote}
    Logic would take you by the throat, and \emph{force} you to do it!%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[280]{Carroll:1895uj})}
  \end{quote}
  Looking at something static.
  Achilles fails to convey this to the Tortoise, arguably through some fault of Achilles' own.

  In parallel, we could stack up additional passives in the same way, but there's little interest in doing so.
  The point is the base \requ{} is not satisfied.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, with \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj}, we get a rule of inference, great.

  \citeauthor{Wieland:2013vf} characterises the general understanding of \textcite{Carroll:1895uj} in terms of two lessons:
  \begin{quote}
    [T]he negative lesson is that if you add ever more premises to an argument \dots, then you will never demonstrate that its conclusion follows logically.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[984]{Wieland:2013vf})}
  \end{quote}

  Parallel, static answers, still option for concluding otherwise.

  \begin{quote}
    [T]he positive lesson is that rules of inference, rather than premises of the form `if premises such and such are true, then the conclusion is true', will do the job.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[984]{Wieland:2013vf})}
  \end{quote}

  Parallel, the dynamic status of a rule.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Similar, but a little different.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  No regress.

  Following \citeauthor{Wieland:2013vf}:

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item[IR]
      For any item x of a certain type, S \(\varphi\)-s x only if
      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),noitemsep]
      \item
        there is a new item y of that same type, and
      \item
        S \(\varphi\)-s y.%
        \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[996]{Wieland:2013vf})}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{quote}

  Now, concluding, versus would conclude.
  However, focus is before concluding.
  So, would conclude and would conclude.

  Difficulty is, it's not at all clear this is the case.
  Need to be sure that there is a \requ{} for any \requ{}.
  Yet, from agent's perspective.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Interesting thing here is that it's not `just' the rule.

  \emph{And}, important difference is that the agent isn't moving from premises to conclusion.
  Following the standard interpretation, \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} gets us that there's a rule in play when agent concludes.
  (Or, more strictly, modus ponens\dots)
  But, this is very different from something similar being active when drawing some other conclusion.

  So, there is a link to \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj}, but it is somewhat indirect.
  Still, this should soften the conclusion.

  In short, with \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} it's the rule.
  Here, it's the ability to employ the rule.
\end{note}

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{note}
  Important limitation here is that \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{}.

  This need not be the case.

  For example, consider discussion of~\autoref{illu:gist:calc}.
  Testimony.
  Failure of a \requ{}.

  It is possible that a prior conclusion of \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) prevents \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) being a \requ{}.

  However, in general, this is a bad response.
  For, this would result in discounting the agent's present epistemic state.

  No doubt, some conclusions are more secure that others.
  However, such a hierarchy is not temporal.
\end{note}

\section{\fc{3} and support}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:fc3-support}

\begin{note}
  This is where things get somewhat difficult.

  This is something we need to argue for.

  The term is suggestive, `conclusion', and concluded only if support.
  However, the agent has not concluded, so assumption doesn't do any work.%
  \footnote{
    Variant of this argument in which argue that the agent concludes.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}
    For any path, present epistemic state determines availability of path.
  \end{proposition}

  Start.
  Then, continue.
  Started from \(\Phi\), so will conclude.
  Hence, no matter choice made, must have taken the possibility of this choice into account.
  So, it must be the case that determined.

  Hence, if witness, then via some path.

  So, witnessing predetermined path.
  Any instances of concluding by witnessing reduces to witnessing predetermined path.

  Witnessing may provide information about path, but witnessing doesn't 


  For any X from W,
  present determines whether or not X from agent's point of view, then forgone conclusion.

  In other words, agent's present epistemic state determines.
  Agent may need to witness to figure out how determined, but witnessing does not influence.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Two worries]
  Two worries.

  First, that even though \fc{0}, the agent would not conclude.
  Either because \(\Phi\) is unavailable, or because no potential witnessing event.
  So, can't remove \fc{0} from account of why.

  However, then \fc{0} does not support.

  If grant that \fc{0} supports, then this seems to work out.
  Further, if require existence, then things that support get very messy.
  Dopeganger cases.
  Reason is I saw A, but it wasn't A, appealing to something that doesn't exist.
  Various other cases like this.

  Difference.
  In these cases, have premise, thing is that the truth value is distinct.
  Here, possibly no premise.

  Well, this is different.
  However, I don't think this is sufficient to reject the idea.
  Just because this distinction doesn't arise in the case of witnessing doesn't really do much.

  Look, a `bad' premise offers no more support for the agent than no premise.

  Second, need \emph{that} \fc{0}.
  However, the point is that this is about the agent's present epistemic state.
  \emph{Without} \fc{0}, the agent would reason.
  This is just the key point reiterated.
  Know whether, \fc{0} just adds information about which.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Knowing whether}

\begin{note}[Intuitive cases]
  Knowing whether and knowing how to.
  More or less interchangeable.

  Know whether \(x + y = z\).
  Know how to calculate \(x + y\).
  Indeed, for any \(z\), know whether \(x + y = z\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  To \illu{0}, questions and answers.

  Do you know whether \(83\) is prime?

  Not off the top of my head.

  Do you know whether \(28 + 55 = 83\)?

  Sure, but give me a moment.

  Do you know whether \dots

  No.

  Of course, might hold that the agent needs to have figured things out.
  But, then we have a plausible reduction.
  Knowing whether, and witnessing whether.
  Common component.

  Now, idea is a little different, as knowledge implies factivity.
  Interest with concluding is that not necessarily factive.
  From the agent's perspective.

  `Determining whether'.
  Or, rather `\fc{0}'.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \fc{2} is weaker.
  Knowing, factive.
  Though, plausible that these amount to the same thing in various cases.
  Either because \fc{} is determined by knowing how to.
  Or, because knowing is weakened to the agent's perspective.

  Sudoku puzzles.
  Know how to figure out.
  So, know whether any solution is valid.

  Of course, in certain cases, there are shortcuts.
  Two even numbers, then know whether by checking whether the last digit is even or odd.
  And, other cases, contingent shortcut, such as two of the same number in a square for Sudoku.

  So, really, knowing how to.
\end{note}

\subsection{Literature}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:literature}

\subsubsection{Dispositions}
\label{sec:dispositions}

\begin{note}[Parallel between dispositions and ability]
  Consider \citeauthor{Choi:2021wg}'s characterisation of the Simple Conditional Analysis of dispositions:
  \begin{quote}
    An object is disposed to \emph{M} when \emph{C} iff it would \emph{M} if it were the case that \emph{C}.\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear{Choi:2021wg})}
  \end{quote}
  For example, an object is disposed to dissolve when it is placed in water iff the object would dissolve if it were the case that it is placed in water.

  The Simple Conditional Analysis may be challenged, but for our purposes it is adequate.
  We are interested in the broad form of the truth condition, and various more refined analyses share the same broad form.
  Note, in particular, that it being the case that \emph{C} and \emph{M} happening describes an event.
  Given appropriate conditions; salt dissolves, glass breaks, and I mumble when I am tired.
  The key idea is that the property of being disposed to \emph{M} when \emph{C} is analysed in terms of the (possible) event of \emph{M} happening when \emph{C}.

  The parallel to ability is established by noting that ability may also be analysed in terms of a (possible) event, as we have seen.
  In particular, by incorporating volition in the analysans of the Simple Conditional Analysis.
  To illustrate, \citeauthor{Mandelkern:2017aa} trace the Conditional Analysis of ability  to \textcite{Hume:1748tp} and \textcite{Moore:1912te}, among others:
  \begin{quote}
    S can \(\phi\) iff S would \(\phi\) if S tried to \(\phi\)\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[Cf.][308]{Mandelkern:2017aa})}
  \end{quote}
  Compare to the Simple Conditional Analysis of dispositions:
  The object is some agent \emph{S}, \emph{C} is `S tried to \(\phi\)' and \emph{M} is `S \(\phi\)s' --- it is volition alone which distinguishes the analyses.
  For example, I have the ability to demonstrate that a rectangle with dimensions \(19\text{cm}\) by \(7\text{cm}\) has area \(133\text{cm}^{2}\) only if I would demonstrate that a rectangle with dimensions \(19\text{cm}\) by \(7\text{cm}\) has area \(133\text{cm}^{2}\) if it were the case that I tried that a rectangle with dimensions \(19\text{cm}\) by \(7\text{cm}\) has area \(133\text{cm}^{2}\).
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Doxastic justification}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:dox-just}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Turri:2010aa}

  \begin{quote}
    Necessarily, for all S, \emph{p}, and \emph{t}, if \emph{p} is propositionally justified for S at \emph{t}, then \emph{p} is propositionally justified for S at \emph{t} because S currently possesses at least one means of coming to believe \emph{p} such that, were S to believe \emph{p} in one of those ways, S's belief would thereby be doxastically justified.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[316]{Turri:2010aa})}
  \end{quote}

  Key is that doxastic justification depends on what the agent does.

  \citeauthor{Turri:2010aa}'s focus is on how reasons are used.
  What the agent does.

  Seen with example.

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(P\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item
      The Spurs will win if they play the Pistons.
    \item
      The Spurs will play the Pistons.
    \end{enumerate}

    \mbox{}\hfill\(\vdots\)\hfill\mbox{}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(P\arabic*), resume]
    \item
      Therefore, the Spurs will win.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[317]{Turri:2010aa})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  Rather than \emph{modus ponens}, `\emph{modus profusus}'.
  Conclude \(r\) from \(p\) and \(q\).
  (\citeyear[317]{Turri:2010aa})

  \begin{quote}
    The way in which the subject performs, the manner in which she makes use of her reasons, fundamentally determines whether her belief is doxastically justified.
    Poor utilization of even the best reasons for believing \emph{p} will prevent you from justifiedly believing or knowing that \emph{p}.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[316]{Turri:2010aa})}
  \end{quote}

  Variant of ~\cite{Prior:1960wh}'s `tonk' connective.
  Though, difference is between connective and rule.
  \(p\) tonk \(q\) would not be propositionally justified.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Turri:2010aa} is similar to \citeauthor{Goldman:1979ui}

  Begin with justification.


  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{10}
    \item
      Person \emph{S} is \emph{ex ante} justified in believing \emph{p} at \emph{t} if and only if there is a reliable belief-forming operation available to \emph{S} which is such that if \emph{S} applied that operation to this total cognitive state at \emph{t}, \emph{S} would believe \emph{p} at \emph{t}-plus-delta (for a suitably small delta) and that belief would be \emph{ex post} justified.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  Where, sufficient condition for belief would be \emph{ex post} justified:
  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item
      If S's believing \emph{p} at \emph{t} results from a reliable cognitive belief-forming process (or set of processes), then S's belief in \emph{p} at \emph{t} is justified.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[13]{Goldman:1979ui})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}
  Roughly, at least.
  \citeauthor{Goldman:1979ui} refines this a fair bit, but this isn't important.

  Availability of a reliable belief-forming operation!

  Relation here is brittle.
  Account of justification, apply to concluding.
  Well, then all we get is that before concluding, would make sense to conclude only if available.
  Running something like the \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} regress, not some state.
  But, this only tells us about suitability to conclude.

  Still, key point is process.

  Another useful thing to highlight is the suitably small delta.
  With \requ{}, this is captured in terms of the option.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Significant difference is in the case of justification, we're not interested in the agent's perspective.
  Hence, these accounts are understood in terms of the agent having the ability, roughly.

  With \qzS{}, we're interested in the agent's perspective, and there is no guarantee that the agent really has the ability.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Ryle}

\begin{note}
  Ideas regarding \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s distinction between knowing \emph{how} and knowing \emph{that} (Cf.~\citeyear{Ryle:1946tu}).

  Now, I confess my understanding of \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s distinction is limited --- I have not taken whatever opportunities I have had to read through \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s work.%
  \footnote{
    Though, I understand enough from passing commentary to note that the idea \emph{I} am perusing here does not, strictly, require that knowledge how and knowledge that are distinct kinds of knowledge.
    (See~\textcite{Pavese:2022up} for more!)
  }

  Following analogy from~\textcite{Ryle:2009us}:

  \begin{quote}
    Knowing `\emph{if p, then q}' is, \dots rather like being in possession of a railway ticket.
    It is having a licence or warrant to make a journey from London to Oxford.
    (Knowing a variable hypothetical or `law' is like having a season ticket.)
    As a person can have a ticket without actually travelling with it and without ever being in London or getting to Oxford, so a person can have an inference warrant without actually making any inferences and even without ever acquiring the premisses from which to make them.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[250]{Ryle:2009us})}
  \end{quote}

  Continuing~\citeauthor{Ryle:2009us}'s analogy, in the case of positive answers to \qzS{}:
  What matters is that the agent is currently in possession of the (season) ticket.

  Even if current possession of the (season) ticket is knowledge that, it is present knowledge.
  And, present without being applied.
\end{note}


\begin{note}[Trimming]
  \begin{proposition}
    Basically, there's no role for anything beyond \(\Phi\) in the case of a foregone-conclusion.

    \(\Phi\), in the context of the agent's present epistemic state is sufficient to secure the conclusion, and the possibility of witnessing reasoning.
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{proposition}
    Foregone-conclusion just in case \(\Phi\) supports \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
    \begin{argument}
      In short, given agent's present epistemic state, there's a guaranteed path from \(\Phi\) to \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
    \end{argument}
    In other words, if \(\Phi\) does not support \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), then \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is not a foregone-conclusion.
  \end{proposition}

  Now, as the agent has not witnessed reasoning, need information that \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a foregone-conclusion in order to recognise this.
  However, with information that \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a foregone-conclusion, the information has no role in supporting \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, that \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{0} provides information, and explains, in part or whole, \emph{how} the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
  However, \emph{why} is accounted for by \(\Phi\).

\section{Generalising}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:generalising}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:qzs-tick-equals-iCS:var}
    For any property \(\chi\):
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item
      \label{squish:A}
      \squishA{An}{the}
    \end{enumerate}
    \emph{if and only if}:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.,resume]
    \item
      \label{squish:B}
      \(chi\) entails \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \fc{}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}
\end{note}

\subsection{Argument}
\label{sec:argument}

\subsubsection{Right-to-left}
\label{sec:right-left}

\begin{note}
  For the right-to-left direction our goal is to establish:

  For any property \(\chi\):
  \begin{quote}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[B.]
      \squishB{an}
    \end{enumerate}
    \emph{implies}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[A.]
      \squishA{The}{the}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, get \fc{}.
  If this is the case, then positive answer.

  Well, this direction is more-or-less trivial.

  We've basically defined \fc{1} as positive answers to \qzS{}.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Left-to-right}
\label{sec:left-right}

\begin{note}
  For the left-to-right direction our goal is to establish:

  For any property \(\chi\):
  \begin{quote}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[A.]
      \squishA{An}{the}
    \end{enumerate}
    \emph{implies}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[B.]
      \squishB{the}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  To do so, we take some arbitrary property \(\chi\), and then contrapose the conditional.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Here, now, problem.
  By assumption, static.
  Hence, worry.
\end{note}

\section{Foregone-concluding}

\begin{note}[Foregone-concluding]
  Pair this with a key idea.

  \begin{restatable}[Foregone-concluding]{idea}{ideaForegoneCing}
    \label{idea:reassignment}
    If foregone-conclusion, then may conclude.
    %\vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{restatable}

  Cases where concluding by witnessing reduces to witnessing forgone conclusion.
  \emph{Concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) is just witnessing foregone-conclusion.}
  So, reduction, in certain cases.
  Further, if forgone conclusion, then conclude.
  At least, in certain cases.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[???]
  Only argue for a positive resolution to~{\color{red} issue:Main} given~\autoref{idea:reassignment}.

  And, leave~\autoref{idea:reassignment} as an idea.
  Insight into adopting this idea, or something like this.
