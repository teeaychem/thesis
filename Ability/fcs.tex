\section{Introduction}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:introduction}

\begin{note}
  \autoref{sec:clar:type-of-scen} introduced the general type of \scen{} we are interested in.
  In \autoref{cha:zS}, \check{1} on concluding.

  Here, \fc{1}.

  General term `foregone conclusion' is ambiguous.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Inevitable results of reasoning.
  \item
    Conclusion which has been settled in advance of reasoning.
  \end{itemize}

  Interest is with the second meaning.
  Two examples of general use.

  I guess I've also ended up with an implicit argument which suggests reducing ability to progressive (given assumption).
  Kind of.
  Ability is choice to progress(ive).

  % \begin{quote}
  %   ［どうぜ］\dots Expresses an attitude of resignation or carelessness on the part of the speaker, in the sense that regardless of what s/he does, the conclusion or outcome is foregone and cannot be changed by the will or effort of an individual.%
  %   \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[332--333]{kurufushamashii:2015un})}
  % \end{quote}
  A clear example of the first meaning is found in~\citeauthor{Machover:1996vu}'s~\citetitle{Machover:1996vu}:

  \begin{quote}
    I have omitted its proof, but added a detailed analysis of the meaning of the lemma and the reason why its proof works. When this is understood, the proof itself becomes a mere technicality, almost a foregone conclusion.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[viii]{Machover:1996vu})}
  \end{quote}

  \citeauthor{Machover:1996vu} is discussing a proof, and whether or not it is inevitable that one would complete the proof (conclude that the relevant theorem is true) after understanding the lemma and why it works.
  There is no relevant sense in which the truth of the theorem has been settled in advance of reasoning.
  Though, as the proof is somewhat difficult,~\citeauthor{Machover:1996vu} only states the proof is `almost' a foregone conclusion.%
  \footnote{
    The proof is question is of the G\"{o}del-Rosser First Incompleteness Theorem.
    (\citeyear[Cf.][226]{Machover:1996vu})
  }%
  \(^{,}\)
  \footnote{
    For a similar example without qualification, consider the following from~\textcite{Jacquette:2002up}:
    \begin{quote}
    It is nevertheless important to recognize that Russell’s evaluation of such sentences as false is predetermined by his existence presuppositional semantics for the ‘existential’ quantifier, and by the fact that his logic permits no alternative means of considering the semantic status of sentences ostensibly containing proper names for nonexistent objects.
    This makes it an altogether philosophically foregone conclusion that sentences like ‘Pegasus is winged,’ which many logicians would otherwise consider to be true propositions of mythology, are false.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[6]{Jacquette:2002up})}
  \end{quote}
  }

  For an additional example, consider the following from~\citeauthor{Grice:1957vg}'s~\citetitle{Grice:1957vg}:%
  \footnote{
    Same is found in \textcite[219]{Grice:1989uf}.
  }
  \begin{quote}
    He intends the audience's recognition of his intention to produce that response to be effective in producing that response.
    He does not regard it as a foregone conclusion that his action will produce the intended response, whether or not his intention is recognized.\newline
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[385]{Grice:1957vg})}
  \end{quote}

  In this case, the term `forgone conclusion' is embedded under negation, to highlight that the agent in question entertains the possibility that the agent's action will not produce the intended response.

  By contrast, the following passage from \textcite{Kadane:1996vu} is an example of the second meaning:

  \begin{quote}
    When can a Bayesian select an hypothesis \emph{H} and design an experiment (or a sequence of experiments) to make certain that, given the experimental outcome(s), the posterior probability of \emph{H} will be greater than its prior probably?
    We discuss an elementary result that establishes sufficient conditions under which this reasoning to a foregone conclusion cannot occur.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[1228]{Kadane:1996vu})}
  \end{quote}

  At issue is whether a Bayesian may chose some hypothesis \emph{H} and then guarantee some increase in probability for \emph{H} by running some experiments.
  So, are there cases in which the Bayesian first chooses a hypothesis \emph{H} and then ensures they reason to an increase in the probability of \emph{H}?
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Our interest is with the first meaning, though narrow.
  To avoid ambiguity with first meaning, write `\fc{0}' rather than `foregone conclusion'.
  That is, the hyphen signifies when we are speaking about the technical term.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Breakdown
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \autoref{cha:sec:fcs-def} definition of \fc{0}.
  \item
    \autoref{cha:fcs:sec:broad-motivation}, motivation for \fc{1}.
    Relation to \cScen{1}.
  \item
    \autoref{cha:fcs:sec:fcs-support}, support.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Support.

  Idea here is something distinguished about concluding, but is independent of whether or not the agent has witnessed concluding.

  \autoref{idea:support} and \autoref{idea:support:possible}.

  Noted, independence does not entail relation of support from agent's perspective without concluding.

  Parallel to propositional and doxastic justification.
\end{note}

\section{\fc{3}}
\label{cha:sec:fcs-def}

\paragraph{\fc{} def}

\begin{note}
  The consequent here, potential event.
  Term this a \fc{}.

  \begin{restatable}[Foregone-conclusions]{definition}{definitionForegoneC}
    \label{def:fc}
    For an agent \vAgent{}, and some proposition-value-premises pairing \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\):

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) is a \emph{\fc{0}} from \(\Phi\), with respect to \vAgent{}
    \end{itemize}
    \emph{If and only if}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
    \item
      \label{def:fc:is-pe-good}
      There is some potential event \(p\), \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \item
      \label{def:fc:no-pe-bad}
      No potential event \(p\) in which \vAgent{} conclude something such that would not go on to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{restatable}

 \phantlabel{fcs-neutral-perspective}
  \fc{3} are stated from a neutral perspective --- at issue is whether there is a potential event in which the agent concludes --- however, our interest with \fc{1} will be from an agent's perspective.
  Specifically, whether \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) is a \fc{0} from \(\Phi\) with respect to \vAgent{}, from \vAgent{}' perspective.
  To simplify, we will shorten a positive instance to:
  `\(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{0}, from \vAgent{}' perspective.'
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Basic idea, is straightforward.
  Some motivation with instances of knowing how.
  Or, the agent having the ability to reason (in such a way that culmination of reasoning is a conclusion).

  However, the term `\fc{0}' is a little narrower than broad intuition may suggest.
  For, the event in which the agent conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is qualified by the term `potential'.
\end{note}

\subsection{Potential events}
\label{sec:potential-events}

\begin{note}
  Helper definition.

  \begin{restatable}[Potential event]{definition}{definitionPEvent}
    There is a potential event in which \vAgent{} \(\alpha\)s
    \emph{if and only if}
    some action \(a\) avaiable to the agent, and were the agent to perform \(a\), the agent would be \(\alpha\)-ing.
  \end{restatable}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Definition relies on assumption regarding progressive.
  \begin{quote}
    \(\alpha\)-ing only if, in some sense, future where \(\alpha\)'d.
  \end{quote}

  Assumption is natural.%
  \footnote{
    And common!
    See, for example, the assumption in the following influential papers:
    (\cite{Bennett:1972uw}),
    (\cite{Dowty:1979vq}),
    (\cite{Parsons:1990aa}),
    (\cite{Landman:1992wh}), and
    (\cite{Portner:1998um}).
    However, this assumption is denied by~\textcite{Szabo:2004ul}.
    \citeauthor{Szabo:2004ul} writes:
    \begin{quote}
      Sometimes we are \emph{doing} things even though there is no real chance that we could get them \emph{done}, and this is true even if we abstract away from the possibility of miraculous intervention.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[40]{Szabo:2004ul})}
    \end{quote}
    \citeauthor{Szabo:2004ul} denies~\ref{Szabo:Arch} is necessarily false:
    \begin{quote}
      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*)]
        \setcounter{enumi}{12}
      \item
        \label{Szabo:Arch}
        As the architect was building the cathedral he knew that, although he would be building it for another year or so, he couldn’t possibly complete it.%
        \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[38]{Szabo:2004ul})}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{quote}
    Though,~\ref{Szabo:Arch} seems false to me, without some priming.
    And, the only priming on which~\ref{Szabo:Arch} reads true involves interpreting the architect's knowledge from the architect's perspective, allowing a failure of factivity, thus allowing the cathedral to be built.

    Still, assumption.
    The goal is not to tie potential to progressive, but to evaluation associated with the progressive granting assumption.
  }

  Bring this out via the `imperfective paradox'.

  \citeauthor{Bach:1986tb} summarises:
  \begin{quote}
    [H]ow can we characterize the meaning of a progressive sentences like \ref{Bach:impP:17} on the basis of the meaning of a simple sentence like \ref{Bach:impP:18} when \ref{Bach:impP:17} can be true of a history without \ref{Bach:impP:18} ever being true?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{16}
    \item
      \label{Bach:impP:17}
      John was crossing the street.
    \item
      \label{Bach:impP:18}
      John crossed the street.%
\mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[12]{Bach:1986tb})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  Don't get the entailment.

  \emph{But}, could've.

  Clear example of this from Igal Kvart, via~\textcite{Landman:1992wh}:

  \begin{quote}
    Look at example~\ref{Landman:FRomans}:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{19}
    \item
      \label{Landman:FRomans}
      Mary was wiping out the Roman army.
    \end{enumerate}

    The situation is that Mary, a person of moderate physical capacities, is battling the Roman army.
    She manages to kill a couple of soldiers before she gets killed.
    \ref{Landman:FRomans} is clearly false in this situation.\newline
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[18]{Landman:1992wh})}
  \end{quote}
  Contrapose.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Idea is the progressive ensures somehow, but in a subtle way.
\end{note}

\subsection{Ability(?)}

\begin{note}
  Now, potential event.
  Comes to be the case that agent does \(\alpha\), and has the option.
  Alternative suggestion is to say potential event just in case agent `can \(\alpha\)' or `has the ability to \(\alpha\)'.

  Particular sense of ability.

  Can run 5k.

  However, I'm wasted.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Example of what \textcite{Hackl:1998tt} terms `opportunity-can' (\citeyear[14]{Hackl:1998tt}):

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(92)]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{Hackl:OC:a}
        A star gazer can see the solar eclipse of this year from the Cayman islands.\newline
        So if you were a star gazer and if you were on the Cayman islands at the right time you would see this year's solar eclipse.
      \item
        \label{Hackl:OC:b}
        John can see Mary from where he is standing.\newline
        So if you were standing in his place, you would see Mary.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    [\ref{Hackl:OC:b}] says that whoever is in this situation located at John's position and has normal eyesight and directs his/her gaze towards Mary will succeed in seeing Mary.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[39]{Hackl:1998tt})}
  \end{quote}
  \citeauthor{Hackl:1998tt}'s analysis straightforwardly extends to \ref{Hackl:OC:a}:
  A star gazer who is in the Cayman islands at the right time this year and looks for the solar eclipse will succeed in seeing the solar eclipse.%
  \footnote{
    Whether or not this is \emph{true} is a different matter\dots
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Building on~\citeauthor{Austin:1961vz}:

  \begin{quote}
    Consider the case where what we wish to assert is that somebody had the opportunity to do something but lacked the ability---`He could have smashed that lob, if he had been any good at the smash':
    here the \emph{if}-clause, which may of course be suppressed and understood, relates not to opportunity but to ability.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[177]{Austin:1961vz})}
  \end{quote}
  Likewise for ability:
  \begin{quote}
    `He could have read \emph{Emma}, if he had had a copy', does seem to assert `categorically' that he had a certain ability, although he lacked the opportunity to exercise it.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[177]{Austin:1961vz})}
  \end{quote}

  This combination is difficult.
  Broad sense of ability, from Austin.
  But, these two things don't need to come together.

  Made some mistaken in a proof.
  Ability to conclude.
  However, not `categorically' that I have ability.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[General and specific]
  \phantlabel{ability-g-s-dist}
  \nocite{Maier:2018uo}
  Distinction between `general' or `global' and `specific' or `local' abilities.
  \citeauthor{Whittle:2010wr}: `what an agent is able to do in a large range of circumstances' and `what the agent is able to do now, in some particular circumstances' (\citeyear[2]{Whittle:2010wr}).%
  \footnote{
    Though, see~\textcite[esp.\ \S4]{Kittle:2015tb} and~\textcite[1--2]{Kikkert:2022wp} for additional discussion on this distinction.
  }

  `general' ability conclude X.
  In large range of cases, conclude X.

  `specific' ability conclude \~X.
  Bad information.
  And, failure to conclude/lack of ability highlights that something has gone wrong.
  And, at issue is the specific instance.

  One way to view this, concluding is specific, reasoning is general.
  General speaking a strong relation between general reasoning and specific concluding.
  However, not always.

  So, interest is with `specific' or `local', and indirectly with `general' to the extent that general leads to an instance of specific.

  Hence, we set aside \citeauthor{Austin:1961vz}'s `categorical' ability.
  Likewise we set aside `general' accounts of ability such as~\citeauthor{Carter:2021wd}'s~(\citeyear{Carter:2021wd}) `fallibilist',~\citeauthor{Kikkert:2022wp}'s~(\citeyear{Kikkert:2022wp}) `robust', and \citeauthor{Maier:2013vk}'s (\citeyear{Maier:2013vk}) `general' account, among others.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  However, possible that an account of specific ability does the work.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Past Success. \(\text{Past}(S\text{ }\phi) \leadsto \text{Past}(S\text{ can }\phi)\)%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[2?]{Boylan:2020aa})}
  \end{enumerate}
  Past Success.
  This captures specific.

  This doesn't hold for \fc{1}.
  So, problem with reducing to ability.

  Though, this is not so straightforward.
  Endorses past success, but denies \(\lor\)- Success.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Invalidity of \(\lor\)- Success. \(S\text{ [will] }\phi \lor S\text{ [will] }\psi \not\!\!\leadsto S\text{ can }\phi \lor S\text{ can }\psi\)
  \end{enumerate}
  If \(\lor\)- Success fails, then things aren't straightforward.
  Whether or not \fc{}, evaluate prior to concluding.
  No clean mapping, but this isn't a good objection.

  `while the past is settled, the future is open'

  So, may function as an account of \fc{} so long as consider from the perspective of an open future.
  Surely cases where shift perspective.

  `Control intuition'.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  ~\cite{Boylan:2020aa}'s analysis.

  \begin{quote}
    \emph{Unsettled World}. \(\mathcal{I}_{c} = \{w \mid w\text{ is identical to }w_{c}\text{ up until }t_{c}\}\)%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[11]{Boylan:2020aa})}
  \end{quote}
  Caution, an unsettled world is a set of worlds.
  \(c\) marks context.%

  \begin{quote}
    \(s(\mathcal{I}, \mathbf{A})\) picks out the closest (possibly unsettled) world to \(\mathcal{I}\) which settles that \(\mathbf{A}\) is true.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[11]{Boylan:2020aa})}
  \end{quote}
  So, selection function returns set containing a world or collection of worlds.

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \setcounter{enumi}{33}
    \item
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        \(\sem[w,t,f,\mathcal{I}]{\mathcal{W}\phi}\) is determinate only if either
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item
          \(s(\mathcal{I}, f(w,t)) \subseteq \sem[t,f,\mathcal{I}]{\phi}\) or
        \item
          \(s(\mathcal{I}, f(w,t)) \subseteq \sem[t,f,\mathcal{I}]{\lnot\phi}\)
        \end{enumerate}
      \item
        If determinate \(\sem[w,t,f,\mathcal{I}]{\mathcal{W}\phi} = 1\) iff \(s(\mathcal{I}, f(w,t)) \subseteq \sem[t,f,\mathcal{I}]{\phi}\)
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    Here, \(w\) world, \(t\) time, \(f\) a function from a world and a time to a set of worlds, and \(\mathcal{I}\) an unsettled world.
    \(f(w,t) = \top\), option to restrict what the section function picks out.
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \setcounter{enumi}{41}
    \item
      \(\sem[w,t,f,\mathcal{I}]{\text{S can }\phi} = 1\) iff for some \(\alpha \in \mathcal{A}\colon \sem[w,t,f^{\alpha},\mathcal{I}]{\mathcal{W}(\text{S }\phi\text{'s})} = 1\)\newline
      i.e.\ iff for some \(\alpha \in \mathcal{A}(w,t)\colon s(\mathcal{I}, f^{\alpha}(w,t)) \subseteq \sem[t,f^{\alpha},\mathcal{I}]{\text{S }\phi\text{'s}} = 1\)\newline
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[16]{Boylan:2020aa})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}
  Here, key thing is \(f^{\alpha}\).
  We're making sure that the agent performs the action in the unsettled world.

  In short, we chose some action, and figure out whether it's a phing action.

  Now, Past Success, as context supplies \(\mathcal{I}\).
  This means, everything up until now is settled.
  So, when evaluate from the past, get a world in which \(\phi\), for sure.

  However, \(\lor\)-Success fails, because open.

  So, here's the thing.
  Failure of \(\lor\)-Success motivated our interest.
  But, to ensure failure, guaranteed by some action available to the agent.

  However, need to be careful about actions.
  Narrow, then works out, but then plausibly run into cases of \(\lor\)-Success.
  Broad, and then don't get instance of ability.

  So, this turns on what actions are `available' to the agent.
  \begin{quote}
    I think of an agent’s available actions as their options.
    And, for simplicity at least, we can typically think of options as a set of tryings.\newline
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[14]{Boylan:2020aa})}
  \end{quote}

  So, key assumption is that the agent has \emph{choice} over actions.
  But, for our purposes, no guarantee.
  Any action, may fail.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Option here to weaken.
  \(\langle \mathcal{W} \rangle\) so non-empty intersection.
  `Orthodox' approach of~\textcite{Hilpinen:1969vw}%
  \footnote{
    Though,~\citeauthor{Hilpinen:1969vw} is a little more subtle.
    For,~\citeauthor{Hilpinen:1969vw} draws a distinction between:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(A\(^{/}{'}\)), ref=(A\(^{/}{'}\))]
    \item
      \label{Hilpinen:A}

      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[181--182]{Hilpinen:1969vw})}
    \end{enumerate}
    Where, the notion of possibility stated in~\ref{Hilpinen:A} is \emph{relativised} to John.
  }
  \textcite{Kratzer:1977aa,Kratzer:1981vn}~and ~\textcite{Lewis:1976us}.
  However, too weak.%
  \footnote{
    See also \textcite[\S1.3]{Boylan:2020aa} and \textcite[\S2]{Mandelkern:2017aa}
  }
  For, now, just need some case.
  But, agent reasons to both.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Control is really strong.
  Lots of things could go wrong when reasoning.
  Interrupted at any time, or stick in a loop.
  Or, boredom.
  Chess, particular answer, but wow I'm likely to get bored.

  The right circumstances, but the point is, circumstances may not be right.

  Still, half the picture, sufficient control such that wouldn't prevent.
  But, avoiding failure is not the same as ensuring success.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Independent difficulty}

\begin{note}
  This is the `plan' account of ability.
  It's kind of insane.
  Whether or not ability reduces to action such that choice and secure outcome.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  This is kind of wild.
  For, actions are kind of huge.
  Similar to that paper with minimalism about intentions.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Our direct interest with account finishes with universal.
  However, clear additional problem.
  Co-operation.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Uh, think.
  Has the ability to X with my help.
  There's no action in advance.
  For, whatever is chosen, I intervene prior, changing the course.
  Well, the point is, I only help if the agent gives up on whatever they had been planning to do.

  This isn't odd, cooperative activity.
  So, actually, refine example a little.
  For, point is that there's the cooperation condition.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Though, this gets difficult.
  For, closest world(s).
  Leaves things unclear.
  Further, in highlighting the problem, miracles.
\end{note}

\subsection{The Progressive}

\begin{note}
  End up here, is progressive.

  On a specific, but common analysis.
  Progressive just in case possible for there to be an event in which finished.

  Start, and progressive is true.

  Well, a specific account of the progressive.

  So, for all, available action, and that action is \(\alpha\)ing.

  As an aside, what does this say about darts?
  Far weaker, right?
  Though, why not just deny doing any of the other things?
\end{note}

\paragraph{\citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}'s account of the progressive}
\nocite{Portner:1998um}
\nocite{Engelberg:1999vi}

\begin{note}
  Borrow summary from \citeauthor{Szabo:2004ul}
  \begin{quote}
    [A] progressive sentence is true at some time just in case some event occurs at that time, and if we follow the development of the event (within our world as long as it goes, then jumping into a nearby world, and iterating the process within the limits of reasonability) we will reach a possible world where the perfective correlate is true of the continuation.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[34]{Szabo:2004ul})}
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \label{prog:max:bad}
    Max was crossing the street.
  \end{enumerate}
  True just in case there is some continuation of the actual world such that in that world, Max crossed the street.

  In the actual world, Max doesn't cross the street because Max is hit by a bus cruising at thirty miles per hour.
  (\citeyear[764]{Portner:1998um})
  Intuitively, however, \ref{prog:max:bad} remains true.
  Max was hit by the bus, but Max was not destined to be hit by the bus.
  And, if Max had not been hit by the bus, Max would have continued to cross the street.
  In other words, there is some possible world \(v\) that branched from the actual world before Max was hit by the bus.
  And, in \(v\) Max was not by the bus, and continued a little further across the road.

  Still, behind bus \#1 a second bus, bus \#2, was ready to hit max.
  And, in \(v\) Max was hit by bus \#2.
  (\citeyear[766]{Portner:1998um})
  However, like bus \#1 in \(w\), Max was not destined to be hit by bus \#2 in \(v\).
  Hence, there is some world \(u\) which branched from \(v\) in which Max continued a little further across the road.

  So long as there are a finite number of busses and no bus is destined to hit Max, then prior to being hit by a given bus, Max makes it a little further across the road.
  And, so long as the road is finite, it follows that eventually Max will have crossed the road.

  Max was rather unfortunate to be hit by a bus, but fortunes may be reversed.

  \item
    \label{prog:max:good}
    Max was failing at the exam.
  \end{enumerate}

  Multiple choice.
  Max goes for broke.
  For each question, Max puts down the right answer.
  However, Max was not destined to write down the correct answer there is a branch from how things actually happened in which Max chose the incorrect answer.
  And, after a sequence of incorrect choices, Max failed the exam.

\begin{note}
  Continuation branch:

  \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}'s account is as follows:
  \begin{quote}
    The \emph{continuation branch} for \(e\) in \(w\) [, \(C(e,w)\),] is the smallest set of pairs of events and worlds such that
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      \label{Landman:CB:continues}
      for every event \(f\) in \(w\) such that \(e\) is a stage of \(\langle f,w \rangle \in C(e,w)\);
      the continuation stretch of \(e\) in \(w\);
    \item
      \label{Landman:CB:stops}
      if the continuation stretch of \(e\) in \(w\) stops in \(w\), it has a maximal element \(f\) and \(f\) stops in \(w\).
      Consider the closest world \(v\) where \(f\) does not stop:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=--]
      \item
        if \(v\) is not in \(R(e, w)\), the continuation branch stops.
      \item
        if \(v\) is in \(R(e, w)\), then \(\langle f,v \rangle \in C(e,w)\).
        In this case, we repeat the construction:
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \label{Landman:CB:continues:again}
      for every \(g\) in \(v\) such that \(f\) is a stage of \(g\), \(\langle g,v \rangle \in C(e,w)\), the continuation stretch of \(e\) in \(v\);
    \item
      \label{Landman:CB:stops:again}
      if the continuation stretch of \(e\) in \(v\) stops, we look at the closest world \(z\) where its maximal element \(g\) does not stop:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=--]
      \item
        if \(z\) is not in \(R(e, w)\), the continuation branch stops.
      \item
        if \(z\) is in \(R(e, w)\), then \(\langle g,z \rangle \in C(e,w)\) and we continue as above, etc.%
        \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[26--27]{Landman:1992wh})}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  `Reactive'.
  Take an event, for any event of which it is a stage.
  Then, if \(e\) stops, shift to closest world in which \(e\) does not stop.
  Then, so long as reasonable, continue the construction.
  So long as there's a reasonable way to continue \(e\), keep going.

\begin{note}
  Finally, \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}'s account of the progressive:
  \begin{quote}

    \phantom{an} and \(\sem{P}_{v,g}(f) = 1\)\par

    where \(\text{CON}(g(e), w)\) is the continuation branch of \(g(e)\) in \(w\).\newline
        \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[27]{Landman:1992wh})}
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\paragraph{Algorithmic (re)construction}

\begin{note}
  Breaking this down into a recursive algorithm.
  Goal is to create a tree, which will be a set of ordered event-world-pairing pairs indexed according to depth.
  So, \(\{\langle \langle e,w \rangle_{0}, \langle f,w \rangle_{1} \rangle, \langle \langle f,w \rangle_{1}, \langle h,u \rangle_{2} \rangle, \langle \langle f,w \rangle_{1}, \langle h,v \rangle_{2} \rangle, \dots \}\)
  Root, inital event world pair, and then branch from event world pair to some distinct event world pair just in case ordered pair.
  %
  \footnote{
    The indexing is not required to construct the tree.
    However, important for keeping track of the stage of construction.
  }

  Pseudocode in the style of ~\textcite{Cormen:2009uw}

  We start by identifying three basic functions, and following a (re)construction of these functions with explanation added, we (re)construct a recursive function to build a continuation branch of some event-world pairing.

  The three basic functions will be termed:
  `\textsc{Get-Continuations}', `\textsc{Get-Stops}', and `\textsc{Find-Branches}'.
  And the recursive function will be termed:
  `\textsc{Build-CTree}'.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  First function `\textsc{Get-Continuations}'.
  Clause~\ref{Landman:CB:continues} (and~\ref{Landman:CB:continues:again}) of \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}'s definition of a continuation branch.
  \begin{quote}
    \textsc{Get-Continuations}(\(\langle \langle e,w \rangle_{i}, \langle g,u \rangle_{i+1}  \rangle\))\newline
    let Continuations = \(\{\langle h,u \rangle_{i+1} \mid g \text{ is a stage of } h \text{ in } u \}\)\newline
    \textbf{return} \(\{\langle \langle g,u \rangle_{i+1}, \langle h,u \rangle_{i+1} \rangle \rangle \mid \langle h,u \rangle_{i+1} \rangle \in \text{Continuations}\}\)
  \end{quote}
  Fix world of interest.
  Then, collect all of the events of which event of interest is a stage.
  So, all the events that event of interest is a significant part.
  This requires an existential in the account of the progressive.%
  \footnote{
    Problem for \citeauthor{Szabo:2004ul}'s suggestion of universal quantification.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Next function is termed `\textsc{Get-Stops}'.
  Antecedent of clause~\ref{Landman:CB:stops} (and~\ref{Landman:CB:stops:again}) of \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}'s definition of a continuation branch.

  If an event stops, then want to see if it's possible to shift to a new world to continue event.

  This shifts forward, but does not shift the world of evaluation.
  Algorithm will terminate if no stops.
  Hence, index for next call.

  Argument is a set of pairings.
  Specifically, when called will be set of continuations.
  Hence, title this as such.
  \begin{quote}
    \textsc{Get-Stops}(Continuations)\newline
    let Stops = an empty set\newline
    \textbf{for} \(\langle \langle e,w \rangle_{i}, \langle g,u \rangle_{i+1}  \rangle\) in Continuations\newline
    \phantom{mm} \textbf{if} \(\langle g,u \rangle_{i+1}\) stops in \(u\) \newline
    \phantom{mmmm} Stops \(\cup\) \(\langle g',u \rangle_{i+1}\) such that \(g'\) is the maximal continuation of \(g\) in \(u\)\newline
    \textbf{return} \(\{\langle \langle g,u \rangle_{n+1}, \langle h,u \rangle_{n+2}  \rangle \rangle \mid \langle h,u \rangle_{n+1} \rangle \in \text{Stops}\}\)
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Find branches.
  See if the event at some world continues in some other world.
  \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh} assumes closest world, but following \textcite[37]{Szabo:2004ul}, in part, allow for multiple closest worlds.%
  \footnote{
    Building on `multiple-choice paradox' from~\textcite{Bonomi:1997uq}
  }
  Note, importance of \(e\) and \(w\)!
  No shift in index, as the function identifies the same event in some other possible world.

  \begin{quote}
    \textsc{Find-Branches}(\(\langle \langle f,v \rangle_{n}, \langle g,u \rangle_{n+1}\rangle, e, w\))\newline
    let CloseWorlds = \(\{u' \mid u' \text{ is among the closest world to } u\}\)\newline
    \textbf{return} \(\{ \langle \langle f,v \rangle_{n}, \langle g,u' \rangle_{n+1}\rangle \mid u' \in \text{CloseWorlds} \cap R(e,w)\}\)
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Reasonable]
  Nearby worlds and what is reasonable.

  Restrictions on the branching.
  Nearby is no problem.
  Consider instances of the progressive, figure it out.
  Reasonable is more difficult.
  From the perspective of an agent.
  Semantics.

  Function here is to keep closeness tied to original event.
  As a descriptor, reasonable is difficult.
  However, the function here is not inherently epistemic.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  With these functions in hand, recursive algorithm to build the tree.
  Pass some partially completed tree, along with \(e\), \(w\), and stage.
  We then look at the ordered pairs such that second element in event-world pairing.
  Get the stops for all of these.
  Add the stops to the current tree.
  Then, find branches for all of these.
  If no branches, then we're done, there is no possible continuation of \(e,w\).
  However, if branches, then repeat the function with the grown tree and index shifted forward.

  \begin{quote}
    \textsc{Build-CTree}(\(\text{CurrentTree}, e, w, n\))\newline
    \textbf{for} \(\langle \langle f,v \rangle_{n - 1}, \langle g,u \rangle_{n}\rangle \in \text{CurrentTree}\)\newline
    \phantom{mm} let Continuations = \textsc{Get-Continuations}(\(\langle \langle f,v \rangle_{n - 1}, \langle g,u \rangle_{n}\rangle\))\newline
    \phantom{mm} CurrentTree = CurrentTree \(\cup\) Continuations\newline
    \phantom{mm} let Stops = \textsc{Get-Stops}(Continuations)\newline
    \phantom{mm} \textbf{if} Stops is empty\newline
    \phantom{mmmm} \textbf{return} CurrentTree\newline
    \phantom{mm} \textbf{else}\newline
    \phantom{mmmm} let NewBranches be an empty set\newline
    \phantom{mmmm} \textbf{for} \(\langle \langle g,u \rangle_{n}, \langle h,u \rangle_{n+1}\rangle\) in Stops\newline
    \phantom{mmmmmm} NewBranches \(\cup\) \textsc{Find-Branches}(\(\langle \langle g,u \rangle_{n}, \langle h,u \rangle_{n+1}\rangle, e, w\))\newline
    \phantom{mmmm}\textbf{if} NewBranches is empty\newline
    \phantom{mmmmmm} \textbf{return} CurrentTree\newline
    \phantom{mmmm}\textbf{else}\newline
    \phantom{mmmmmm} CurrentTree = CurrentTree \(\cup\) NewBranches\newline
    \phantom{mmmmmm} \textsc{Build-CTree}(CurrentTree, \(e,w, n+1\))\newline
  \end{quote}

  Now, start with \(\langle e,w \rangle\).
  Slight thing, ordered pairs.
  So, pass a vacant event.
  Run, \textsc{Build-Tree}(\(\langle \langle -,- \rangle_{0}, \langle e,w \rangle_{1} \rangle, e, w, 1\))
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  This gives us continuation tree.
  Following \citeauthor{Szabo:2004ul}, revise account of the progressive.

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Roman*), ref=(\Roman*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{5}
    \item
      \emph{Prog}[\(\varphi\)] is true at \(t\) in \(w\) iff there is an \(e\) at \(t\) in \(w\) and for every \(\langle e^{\ast}, w^{\ast} \rangle\) on the continuation tree for \(e\) in \(w\) if \(\varphi\) is not true of \(e^{\ast}\) at \(w^{\ast}\) then there is an \(\langle e', w' \rangle\) on the continuation tree for \(e\) in \(w\) such that \(e'\) is a continuation of \(e^{\ast}\) in \(w'\) and \(\varphi\) is true of \(e'\) at \(w'\).%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[37]{Szabo:2004ul})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  Note, here, for every there exists.
  Existential is important, because there are so many events.

  As an aside, this plausibly also gets failure of \(\lor\)-Success.
  Surprising, this seems to capture all the entailments that \citeauthor{Boylan:2020aa} is interested in.
  Though, I think we've just reduced ability to choice of action.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  potential event just in case there is some action avaiable to the agent, and were the agent to perform the action, the agent would be \(\alpha\)-ing.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  With respect to concluding, reasonable constraint is neat.
  How the agent is in the actual world.
  And, shifts to closest worlds avoid blunders.
\end{note}



\begin{note}
  False negatives.
  \(\varphi\) to \(prog \varphi\).
  But, this entailment isn't really of interest.
  At least get this in the case of concluding.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  May think there's a problem.

  For, going back to ability.
  Failure of \(\lor\)-Success.
  Plausible fails for the progressive.
  More directly, \(\lor\)-Success holds for the progressive.

  Problem for \fc{1}?
  Not immediately.
  Need this to conflict.
  However, if it does, then a issue with the second clause.

  Weaker issue, `luck'.
  Or, jumping to conclusions.
  But, in this case, potential event in which agent concludes that step of reasoning is bad.
  Hence, incompatible.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In contrast to \citeauthor{Boylan:2020aa}, lax with actions available to the agent!

  Very similar to Orthodox account of ability.
  Common feature is looking forward to a completion.
  But, details.
  \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}, initial event, build on this.
  Do not simply look for some completion.
  This is the core feature of the progressive.
  In part, forward looking.
  See \textcite{Portner:1998um} for a way to fit the progressive into an the type of analysis from the Orthodox account of ability/can.

\subsection{Opportunity}
\label{sec:potential}


\begin{note}
  \begin{restatable}[Opportunity]{definition}{definitionOpportunity}
    Opportunity to \(\alpha\) \emph{if and only if} potential event and \(\alpha\) of event does not require success.
  \end{restatable}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Potential.

  As stated, for an agent.
  More explicit, indexed in various ways.
  Knowing whether, before learnt the rules of chess, valid move was not known whether.

  Relevant index is the agent, as they are.
  Potential, right now.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Importance]
  Constraining \fc{1} to \emph{potential} events is of some importance.

  In following chapter, tie \fc{1} to instances of concluding.

  For example, event of concluding \(x + y = z\), and same.

  Potential, substitute conclusion.
  With failure cases, more difficult.
  Not the case potential, then would not have done the reasoning.
\end{note}

\subsection{Fragility}
\label{sec:fragility}

{
  \color{red}
  Strong conditions on \fc{1}.
  If were to reason, would conclude.
  If not reason, then wouldn't go for something incompatible.

  Whether or not \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{}, then, strong.

  This is stronger than ability.
  Ability, intuitively, just looks as success cases.
  Well, with closeness.
  Things get a little more complex.

  Problem for me is lose specification of concluding.
  Instead of solving these issues directly, our interest will be from agent's perspective.
  Plausible that from agent's perspective, not an instance of concluding.
  Whether or not issues arise, is it plausible that turn interest to cases in which agent's perspective is such that issues don't arise.

\paragraph{Knowing whether and knowing how}

\begin{note}
  Read the above examples in terms of knowing whether.

  More-or-less direct link between knowing whether and knowing how:

  Know whether \(?\{a,b,c,\dots\}\) know how to answer whether it is the case that \(?\{a,b,c,\dots\}\)
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Ideas regarding \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s distinction between knowing \emph{how} and knowing \emph{that}~(Cf.~\citeyear{Ryle:1946tu}).

  Now, I confess my understanding of \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s distinction is limited --- I have not taken whatever opportunities I have had to read through \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s work.%
  \footnote{
    Though, I understand enough from passing commentary to note that the idea \emph{I} am perusing here does not, strictly, require that knowledge how and knowledge that are distinct kinds of knowledge.

    Intellectualist and anti-intellectualist views.

    For, granting that knowledge how reduces to knowledge that, it will remain the case that there is an event\dots
    (See~\textcite{Pavese:2022up} for more!)
  }

  Following analogy from~\textcite{Ryle:2009us}:

  \begin{quote}
    Knowing `\emph{if p, then q}' is, \dots rather like being in possession of a railway ticket.
    It is having a licence or warrant to make a journey from London to Oxford.
    (Knowing a variable hypothetical or `law' is like having a season ticket.)
    As a person can have a ticket without actually travelling with it and without ever being in London or getting to Oxford, so a person can have an inference warrant without actually making any inferences and even without ever acquiring the premisses from which to make them.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[250]{Ryle:2009us})}
  \end{quote}

  Continuing~\citeauthor{Ryle:2009us}'s analogy, in the case of \fc{1}:
  What matters is that the agent is currently in possession of the (season) ticket.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The relationship between \fc{1} and knowing whether is interesting.
  For, as stated, \fc{1}, just about potential event.
  Plausible paraphrase.

  Whether this goes in both directions.

  So, from knowing whether, generally understood, there's got to be an event.
  However, it is not clear to me that there is a `potential' constraint on the event.

  \cite{Bengson:2011th}.
  \begin{quote}
    \emph{Pi}.
    Louis, a competent mathematician, knows how to find the n\(^{\text{th}}\) numeral, for any numeral \(n\), in the decimal expansion of \(\pi\).
    He knows the algorithm and knows how to apply it in a given case.
    However, because of principled computational limitations, Louis (like all ordinary human beings) is unable to find the \(10^{46}\) numeral in the decimal expansion of \(\pi\).%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[170]{Bengson:2011th})}
  \end{quote}

  Conversely, not clear \fc{0} leads to knowing whether.

  Issues here.

  First, factive constraint on knowledge.
  And, concluding need not be factive.

  Though, whether this matters in practice is not clear.
  For, from agent's perspective.

  Second, knowledge is not the right attitude from concluding.
  For example, focus is on deductive cases, but abductive conclusion.
  Or, some doubts about premises.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Barker:1975un} suggests:%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Barker:1975un} also, as far as I can tell, endorses the principles.
  }

  \begin{quote}
    Most theorists of knowledge would, it seems, accept the principles:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*), ref=(\Alph*)]
    \item
      \label{Barker:1975un:A}
      If \emph{S} knows whether \emph{p} and \emph{S} believes that \emph{p}, then \emph{p}.
    \item
      \label{Barker:1975un:B}
      If \emph{S} knows whether \emph{p} and \emph{S} believes that not-\emph{p}, then not-\emph{p}.\newline
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[281]{Barker:1975un})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}
  Though, it seems to me both principles should be rejected.
  For example, consider two agents, \emph{A} and \emph{B} playing chess where each move is timed.
  It's the end game, and \emph{A} believes that \emph{B} has a winning strategy.
  Further, \emph{A} (plausibly) knows whether \emph{B} has a winning strategy.
  For, an observer has determined whether or not \emph{B} has a winning strategy, and \emph{A} is capable of tracing the reasoning of the observer.
  So, if \ref{Barker:1975un:A} holds then \emph{B} has a winning strategy.
  But, the observer knows that \emph{B} \emph{does not} have a winning strategy, and \emph{A}'s belief is mistaken.

    Why this is somewhat interesting.
  }
  However, before turning to the argument for \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support}, it is important to note the limitations of \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support} with respect to \issueConstraint{}.
  For, in order to argue against \issueConstraint{}, need some \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) such that answers \qWhyV{}.
  Answer \qWhyV{} only with dependence.
  Does not follow from \fc{0} that we get dependence.

  Note, also, qualifications.
  From the agent's perspective.
  Mirrored in both cases.
  Plausible that variant of \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support} holds unqualified.
  However, we have said nothing of \support{} independent of agent's perspective.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The argument for \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support} is {\color{red} mostly immediate for ideas regarding support}.

  \begin{goal}
    If conclude only if \fc{}, then support, in part, answers \qWhyV{}.
  \end{goal}

  So, to get answer to \qWhyV{}, need dependency.
  Here, if not \support{} then not \fc{}.
  If not \fc{} then not conclude.

  This is fine, just need to be careful with the counterfactual.
  Relation between \support{} and \fc{} is plain conditional.
  So, it survives any counterfactual changes.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Argument]
  Argument is straightforward.
  Possible support, by assumption.
  Contraposition.
  If not support, then no \fc{}.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Potential relations of support}

\begin{note}
  Start with the following proposition.
  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:fcs-only-if-pot-support}
    For an agent \vAgent{} and proposition-value-premises pairing \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\):
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.)]
      \item
        \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{0}, from \vAgent{}' perspective.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{then}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.), resume]
      \item
        (A) potential (relation of) \support{} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), from \vAgent{}' perspective.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  Argument is fairly straightforward:
  \begin{argument}
    Suppose \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{0}.
    Then, from agent's perspective, potential event in which concludes.
    Now, consider the potential event.
    The culmination of the event, agent concludes.

    So, from~\autoref{idea:support}, a relation of support holds, from the agent's perspective.

    Therefore, in whatever sense event is potential, \support{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) is likewise potential.
  \end{argument}
  From the agent's perspective, there is no difference between witnessed relation of support and potential relation of support.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \emph{Potential} relation of support, but it does not follow that there is a relation of support, from the agent's perspective.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:pot-support-onlyIf-support}
    For an agent \vAgent{} and proposition-value-premises pairing \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\):
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.)]
      \item
        (A) potential (relation of) \support{} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), from \vAgent{}' perspective.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{then}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.), resume]
      \item
        \support{2} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), from \vAgent{}' perspective.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}
    \autoref{idea:support:possible}.
    It is possible for there to be.
    So, we have everything needed.
    Both necessary and sufficient.
    Hence, form agent's perspective, relation of support.

    So, every necessary property that does not involve witnessing.
    But, then, every necessary property.
    Therefore, sufficient.
    For, if not sufficient, then missing a necessary property.
    Contradiction.

    Slight issue, disjunction of properties.
    But, this doesn't change the argument.
    Disjunction.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  Worry.
  \support{2} doesn't rely on witnessing.
  Now, if this goes through, then seems \support{} for any conclusion before making the conclusion.
  However, possible for the agent to reason to different conclusions.
  For, some faulty reasoning.
  Toggle the fault.
  Therefore, \support{} for contradictory conclusions.

\paragraph[Actuality entailments]{Actuality entailments \hfill (Optional)}
\nocite{Bhatt:1999ud}
\nocite{Hacquard:2006to}
\nocite{Werner:2011tp}

\begin{note}
  In this optional section, entertain distinct approach to \autoref{prop:pot-support-onlyIf-support}, and highlight issues.

  If \autoref{prop:pot-support-onlyIf-support}, then strip the modal.

  Actuality entailments.

  \textcite{Alxatib:2019wf} provides the following account of actuality entailments.
  \begin{quote}
    Actuality Entailments (AEs) are inferences from premises that appear to be modal, like (1a), but their content is that the modality is effectuated in the evaluation world --- (1b).

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
      \item Pierre a dû \hspace{26pt} prendre le \hspace{3.5pt} train \newline
        Pierre had.to.\textsc{pfv} take \hspace{14pt} the train\newline
        \hspace{-4pt} ‘Pierre had to take the train'
      \item \emph{Inference}: Pierre took the train.%
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[701]{Alxatib:2019wf})}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  Note, the reading of `had' in (1a) is `unambiguously deontic' (\citeyear[703]{Alxatib:2019wf}).

  Follows \textcite{Bhatt:1999wq} (implication, to avoid commitment to entailment).

  \begin{quote}
    We show that the English ability modal was able to is ambiguous between two readings which can be paraphrased as `managed to' and `had the ability to'.

    \dots

    The two readings associated with be able to allow different interpretive possibilities for indefinite/bare plural subjects.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{317}
    \item
      A fireman was/Firemen were able to eat five apples.
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=\alph*.]
      \item
        Yesterday at the apple eating contest, a fireman was/firemen were able to eat five apples.
        (Past episodic, actuality implication, existentially interpreted subject)
      \item
        In those days, a fireman were/firemen were able to eat five apples in an hour (Generic, no actuality implication, generically interpreted subject)%
        \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor[172--173]{Bhatt:1999wq})}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  If actuality entailment, then possibility of reducing to modal.

  However, clear failure here.
  For, \support{}, but same modal applies to concluding.

  Here, intuitively a significant issue if actuality entailment held.%
  \footnote{
    Inclined to allow concluding without witnessing, but for use, conclude only if witnessed.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{argument}
    Actuality entailment.
    Here, the argument focuses on `potentive'.
    Actuality entailment holds when applied to \support{}.

    Difficulty.
    Interest in actuality entailments focuses on past.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, the point here is that we follow the modality.
  Then, look at similarity.
  Event starts right now.
  So, no different epistemic state.

  Well, the difficulty here is the modal.
  It's possible to go with an account such as Hacquard.
  But, keep the modal, pragmatic link to actual world.

\section{Conclusions, forgone}
\label{sec:fc3-1}

\paragraph{Premises and past conclusions}

\begin{note}[Premises]
  So, as we have seen with testimony, status of a premises blocks a \requ{}.

  Whether the same may hold for this problem.

  It's the case that, part of agent's present epistemic state that they would conclude.

  Problem is, if attempt and fail, then this premise does nothing.
  Their present epistemic state develops into a dead-end.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Note!]
  This doesn't hold in general, for all premises.

  In particular, premise is past conclusion.

  Consider cases of being somewhat impaired, e.g., via exhaustion.
  Indeed, exhaustion is interesting.
  Basic consistency checks.
  Should be the case that conclude A, but just concluded \emph{not}-A, or something like this\dots

  Denying that past continues to secure in all instances.
  So, just need the potential to revise perspective on previous conclusion.
\end{note}

\section{\fc{3} and support}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:fc3-support}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}
    For any path, present epistemic state determines availability of path.
  \end{proposition}

  Start.
  Then, continue.
  Started from \(\Phi\), so will conclude.
  Hence, no matter choice made, must have taken the possibility of this choice into account.
  So, it must be the case that determined.

  Hence, if witness, then via some path.

  So, witnessing predetermined path.
  Any instances of concluding by witnessing reduces to witnessing predetermined path.

  Witnessing may provide information about path, but witnessing doesn't contribute given a \requ{}.

  For any X from W,
  present determines whether or not X from agent's point of view, then forgone conclusion.

  In other words, agent's present epistemic state determines.
  Agent may need to witness to figure out how determined, but witnessing does not influence.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Two worries]
  Two worries.

  First, that even though \fc{0}, the agent would not conclude.
  Either because \(\Phi\) is unavailable, or because no potential witnessing event.
  So, can't remove \fc{0} from account of why.

  However, then \fc{0} does not support.

  If grant that \fc{0} supports, then this seems to work out.
  Further, if require existence, then things that support get very messy.
  Dopeganger cases.
  Reason is I saw A, but it wasn't A, appealing to something that doesn't exist.
  Various other cases like this.

  Difference.
  In these cases, have premise, thing is that the truth value is distinct.
  Here, possibly no premise.

  Well, this is different.
  However, I don't think this is sufficient to reject the idea.
  Just because this distinction doesn't arise in the case of witnessing doesn't really do much.

  Look, a `bad' premise offers no more support for the agent than no premise.

  Second, need \emph{that} \fc{0}.
  However, the point is that this is about the agent's present epistemic state.
  \emph{Without} \fc{0}, the agent would reason.
  This is just the key point reiterated.
  Know whether, \fc{0} just adds information about which.
\end{note}


\section{\fc{3} and ability}
\label{sec:fc3-ability}

\begin{note}
  If \abgen{} ability, then \fc{1}.

  The basic idea is that, \abgen{} ability to reason, specific instances of \abgen{} ability, so these end up as \fc{1}.

  However, the link between these two is somewhat delicate.
  \fc{3} concern potential witnessing events.

  So, it's not the case that ability in general.
  For, may have ability with no opportunity.

  For, if not \fc{}, then no ability.

  Might think this fails to hold.
  For ability, possibility to fail, though preserve the ability.
  However, agent's own reasoning.
  While it's true the agent \emph{may} fail, the link is more general.
  It's not forward looking.
  Rather, there is some potential event.

  Now, the agent may be wrong.
  Fail to have the ability, or something about how things are doesn't line up, and so do not really have the option.
  Still, from agent's perspective.
\end{note}

\section{Scrap}

\begin{note}
  {
    \color{red}
    Move to \requ{} now things have been switched around.
  }
  \fc{} is broader than \requ{}.

  Consider calculator type cases.
