\begin{note}
  Here, \fc{1}.
  Two key things.
  An account of \fc{1}, and connexion between \fc{1} and \ros{1}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If \fc{}, then \ros{}.
  \end{itemize}

  Important idea.
  However, limited.
  Support without witnessing doesn't raise a problem for \issueConstraint{}.
  Rather, support needs to be \emph{why}.

  Main focus is \autoref{cha:sec:fcs-def}.
  What it is for some proposition-value pairing \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) to be a \fc{} from some pool of premises \(\Phi\).
  With the right set-up, \ros{1} --- focus on \autoref{cha:fcs:sec:fcs-support} --- will be simple.

  Progressive, action which is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

\section{Intuition}
\label{sec:intuition}

\begin{note}
  General term `foregone conclusion' is ambiguous.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Inevitable results of reasoning.
  \item
    Conclusion which has been settled in advance of reasoning.
  \end{itemize}

  Interest is with the second meaning.
  Two examples of general use.

  A clear example of the first meaning is found in~\citeauthor{Machover:1996vu}'s~\citetitle{Machover:1996vu}:

  \begin{quote}
    I have omitted its proof, but added a detailed analysis of the meaning of the lemma and the reason why its proof works. When this is understood, the proof itself becomes a mere technicality, almost a foregone conclusion.\newline
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[viii]{Machover:1996vu})}
  \end{quote}

  \citeauthor{Machover:1996vu} is discussing a proof, and whether or not it is inevitable that one would complete the proof (conclude that the relevant theorem is true) after understanding the lemma and why it works.
  There is no relevant sense in which the truth of the theorem has been settled in advance of reasoning.
  Though, as the proof is somewhat difficult,~\citeauthor{Machover:1996vu} only states the proof is `almost' a foregone conclusion.%
  \footnote{
    The proof is question is of the G\"{o}del-Rosser First Incompleteness Theorem.
    (\citeyear[Cf.][226]{Machover:1996vu})
  }%
  \(^{,}\)%
  \footnote{
    For a similar example without qualification, consider the following from~\textcite{Jacquette:2002up}:
    \begin{quote}
      [\dots] Russell's evaluation of such sentences as false is predetermined by his existence presuppositional semantics for the ‘existential' quantifier, and by the fact that his logic permits no alternative means of considering the semantic status of sentences ostensibly containing proper names for nonexistent objects.
      This makes it an altogether philosophically foregone conclusion that sentences like ‘Pegasus is winged,' which many logicians would otherwise consider to be true propositions of mythology, are false.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[6]{Jacquette:2002up})}
    \end{quote}
  }

  For an additional example, consider the following from~\citeauthor{Grice:1957vg}'s~\citetitle{Grice:1957vg}:

  \begin{quote}
    He intends the audience's recognition of his intention to produce that response to be effective in producing that response.
    He does not regard it as a foregone conclusion that his action will produce the intended response, whether or not his intention is recognized.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[385]{Grice:1957vg}/\citeyear[Cf.][219]{Grice:1989uf})}
  \end{quote}

  In this case, the term `foregone conclusion' is embedded under negation, to highlight that the agent in question entertains the possibility that the agent's action will not produce the intended response.

  Likewise, from \citeauthor{kurufushamashii:2015un}:

  \begin{quote}
    ［どうぜ］[\dots] Expresses an attitude of resignation or carelessness on the part of the speaker, in the sense that regardless of what s/he does, the conclusion or outcome is foregone and cannot be changed by the will or effort of an individual.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[332--333]{kurufushamashii:2015un})}
  \end{quote}

  By contrast, the following passage from \textcite{Kadane:1996vu} is an example of the second meaning:

  \begin{quote}
    When can a Bayesian select an hypothesis \emph{H} and design an experiment (or a sequence of experiments) to make certain that, given the experimental outcome(s), the posterior probability of \emph{H} will be greater than its prior probably?
    We discuss an elementary result that establishes sufficient conditions under which this reasoning to a foregone conclusion cannot occur.\newline
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[1228]{Kadane:1996vu})}
  \end{quote}

  At issue is whether a Bayesian may chose some hypothesis \emph{H} and then guarantee some increase in probability for \emph{H} by running some experiments.
  So, are there cases in which the Bayesian first chooses a hypothesis \emph{H} and then ensures they reason to an increase in the probability of \emph{H}?
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Our interest is with the first meaning.
  To avoid ambiguity, and allow deviation from use, we write `\fc{0}' rather than `foregone conclusion'.
  That is, the hyphen signifies when we are speaking about the technical term.
\end{note}

\section{\fc{3}}
\label{cha:sec:fcs-def}

\begin{note}[\fc{2} definition]
  We define a \emph{\fc{0}} as follows:

  \begin{definition}[\fc{3}]
    \label{def:fc}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Proposition: \(\phi\)
      \item
        Value: \(v\)
      \item
        \pool{0}: \(\Phi\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{itemize*}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is a \emph{\fc{0}} for \vAgent{}.
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There is some action \(a\) such that \ref{def:fc:act} and \ref{def:fc:result} are true:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), series=fcCounter]
      \item
        \label{def:fc:act}
        \vAgent{} may do \(a\).
      \item
        \label{def:fc:result}
        \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), after \(a\) is done
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  Intuitively, possible to get \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), and no matter what else get from \(\Phi\), \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) remains possible.

  The progressive is key.
  Important consequences:

  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:fc:pevent}
    There is a \pevent{} in which agent concludes.
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:fc:pevent}
    By definition.
    In particular, \assuPP{}.
  \end{argument}

  Possibility is too general.
  There is a possibility in which I immediately obtain a comprehensive understanding of theoretical computer science and settle whether P is equal to NP (or show that the P versus NP problem is undecidable).
  Hence, \fc{1} are defined with respect to the progressive.

  \begin{observation}
    \label{prop:fc:pevent}
    Allows for failure of event to happen.
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{prop:fc:pevent}
    By understanding of the progressive.
  \end{motivation}

  \begin{observation}
    \label{prop:fc:no-arb}
    Anticipation.
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{prop:fc:no-arb}
    For, need to anticipate the event.
  \end{motivation}

  Variety of consequences.
  For example, no arbitrary.
  Further, limited jumping to conclusions.

  Though, do not overstate.
  It may be the case that the agent jumps.
  But, if so, \fc{} all the same.
  \fc{3} are not normatively constrained.
  Rather, descriptive of an agent.

  \begin{observation}
    \label{prop:fc:lim-luck}
    Limits luck.
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{prop:fc:lim-luck}
    Limited.
    Depends on the event.

    Note, further, that this offers no guarantee that the conclusion is good.
    May be that the agent tends to jump to conclusions.
    However, this is fine.
    For, jumps to conclusions.
  \end{motivation}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  We first consider cases in which \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) (plausibly) \emph{is} a \fc{}.
  Then, we consider cases in which \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is \emph{not} (clearly) a \fc{}.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{\fc{3}}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:illu:yes}

\begin{note}[Chess I]
  \begin{illustration}[Chess I]
    \label{illu:fc:chess:I}
    Consider the following game state:

    \mbox{ }\hfill%
    \begin{adjustbox}{minipage=\linewidth,scale=.9}
      \centering
      \newchessgame[
      setwhite={pa2,pb2,pc2,pd3,pf2,pg3,ra1,re1,bd4,kg1,qe5},
      addblack={ra8,pa7,ba6,pb5,rc8,pd5,pf7,kg8,qg4,ph7,ph4},
      ]%
      \setchessboard{showmover=false}%
      \chessboard
    \end{adjustbox}%
    \label{fig:chess:easy}%
    \hfill\mbox{ }

    Is possible for White to checkmate in a single move?%
    \footnote{
      \citeauthor{Emms:2000aa}' Puzzle 113 (\citeyear[33]{Emms:2000aa}).
    }
  \end{illustration}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \fc{2} of interest:%
  \footnote{
    May also consider whether is possible for White to checkmate in a single move to be a \fc{}, in the sense that it is possible to decide.
    In this case, reduces to solution.
    However, in general decidable may be \fc{} without either answer being a \fc{}.
    In particular, consider an arbitrary first-order formula.
    First-order logic is decidable, however determining which is a different matter.
  }
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    It is possible for White to checkmate in a single move.
  \end{itemize}
  Clearest way is to do the reasoning, and then observe would not have made a different conclusion.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Consider different pieces.
  If like me, first move (\wmove{Qe8}) does not result in checkmate.
  However, do not conclude that it is not possible.
  Other moves to check (e.g\ \wmove{Qf6}, \wmove{Re4}, \wmove{h4}, etc.).

  At some point, consider\wmove{Qh8}, which results in checkmate.

  Simple.
  Key observation is that although not immediate, conclude it is possible for White to checkmate in a single move.
  And, would not have concluded otherwise, or indeed concluded something incompatible which would have prevented (for example, that it is possible for Black's king to move to b8 between the two rooks.)

  Perhaps get bored or distracted, and didn't conclude.
  Remains the case that \fc{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Propositional logic]
  \begin{illustration}[Propositional theorems]
    \label{illu:sketch:prop-logic}
    Suppose an agent has a good grasp of propositional logic.
    In particular:
    The agent has a good understanding of some method to construct semantic proofs.
    For example, by constructing truth tables, or reasoning about valuation functions.

    The agent has some free time, and considers the formula:
    \[
      ((P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P) \rightarrow P
    \]
  \end{illustration}

  Given the agent's understanding of propositional logic, the following is a \fc{}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    For any valuation \(v\), \(v \vDash ((P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P) \rightarrow P \)
  \end{itemize}

  There's nothing particularly special about the formula.
  Given a good understanding, any formula of a reasonable length will do.

  Note, the agent is concluding.
  It's fine for the agent to work things through on a piece of paper.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Non-deductive \illu{1}]
  The following is a simple \illu{} involving non-deductive conclusion:

  \begin{illustration}[Sunny days]
    It's mid summer in the Bay Area.
  \end{illustration}

  For me, it is a \fc{} that it will not rain tomorrow.

  Of course, I recognise there is a possibility that it \emph{may} rain tomorrow.
  However, I haven't checked the weather forecast, and with no information to the contrary I see no way of \emph{failing} to conclude that tomorrow will be sunny.
  You may object, and perhaps I am too quick to conclude that it will not rain tomorrow.

  Still, no matter the gravitas with which I consider the possibility of rain, I am sufficiently committed to some uniformity principle that the principle, combined with past experience, lead me to conclude that it will be sunny tomorrow.
  Hence, prior to reasoning, the truth of the proposition is a \fc{}.%
  \footnote{
    Same extends to various skeptical hypotheses.
    Entertain the possibility that there is no external world, but nothing that prevents me from concluding that there is an external world.
    Though, your perspective on such issues may differ.
  }

  Note, whether or not it rains tomorrow has no bearing on whether or not it is a \fc{} (for me) that it will not rain tomorrow.
  What happens in the future has no direct bearing on what I may (or may not) conclude in the present.%
  \footnote{
    Consider~\citeauthor{Russell:1912th}'s chicken\dots (Cf.~\citeyear[63]{Russell:1912th})
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Poppies]
  We finish the \illu{1} with something a little speculative:

  \begin{illustration}[Poppies]
    \mbox{ }
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{quote}
      Was Tarquinius Superbus in seinem Garten mit den Mohnköpfen sprach, verstand der Sohn, aber nicht der Bote.

      [What Tarquinius Superbus said in the garden by means of the poppies, the son understood but the messenger did not].\newline
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[3]{Kierkegaard:1983ta}/\cite[190]{Hamann:1822vp})}
  \end{quote}
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{illustration}

  The above quite is from the epigraph to~\citeauthor{Kierkegaard:1983ta}'s \hyperlink{cite.Kierkegaard:1983ta}{Fear and Trembling}.
  \hyperlink{cite.Kierkegaard:1983ta}{H.\ Hong and E.\ Hong} detail the relevant background:

  \begin{quote}
    When the son of Tarquinius Superbus had craftily gotten Gabii in his power, he sent a messenger to his father asking what he should do with the city.
    Tarquinius, not trusting the messenger, gave no reply but took him into the garden, where with his cane he cut off the flowers of the tallest poppies.
    The son understood from this that he should eliminate the leading men of the city.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[339]{Kierkegaard:1983ta})}
  \end{quote}
  That he should eliminate the leading men of the city was a \fc{0} for Superbus' son, but not for the messenger.
  Or, at the very least Superbus \emph{expected} the command to eliminate the leading men of the city to be a \fc{} for his son.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Not clearly \fc{1}}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:illu:no}

\begin{note}[Chess II]
  Observation that absence of \fc{} due to failure to conclude extends to other cases.
  What follows is a more difficult chess problem.

  \begin{illustration}[Chess II]
    \label{illu:fc:chess:II}
    Consider the following game state:

    \mbox{ }\hfill%
    \begin{adjustbox}{minipage=\linewidth,scale=0.9}
      \centering
      \newchessgame[
      setwhite={ka5,pa3,pb4,pc4,pe5,pf6,bg5,bh5},
      addblack={pa6,pb7,pc6,pe6,pf7,kc7,nd7,nd4},
      ]%
      \setchessboard{showmover=false}%
      \chessboard
    \end{adjustbox}%
    \label{fig:chess:intro}%
    \hfill\mbox{ }

    It is possible for Black to checkmate in four moves?%
    \footnote{
      \citeauthor{Emms:2000aa}' Puzzle 150 (\citeyear[33]{Emms:2000aa}).
    }
  \end{illustration}

  It is plausible that I would not conclude that it is possible for Black to checkmate in four moves or conversely.

  Though perhaps the bound is too low.
  If I gave it my all and attempted to work my way though all the possibilities present it may be the case that I conclude either way.
  Still, there are a lot of moves to consider, and I lack any intuition about which is correct.%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Emms:2000aa} provides the following solution:
    \begin{quote}
      \variation{1... Nb6!}
      (threatening \variation{2... Nb3\#})
      \variation{2. b5}
      (or \variation{2. Bd1 Nxc4+} \variation{3. Ka4 b5\#})
      \variation{2... c5!}
      \variation{3. bxa6 Nxc4+}
      \variation{4. Ka4 b5\#}
      \textbf{(0-1)}%
      \mbox{}
      \hfill
      (\citeyear[46]{Emms:2000aa})
    \end{quote}
    My statement above remains true---I don't have sufficient background to parse this solution.
  }
  And, if you think I am doing myself a disservice, then a variant of \autoref{illu:fc:chess:II} may be restated with and increase number of moves.
\end{note}

% \begin{note}[ML II]
%   \begin{illustration}[Modal logic II]
%     \label{illu:fc:ML2}
%     The modal system \(\mathbf{GL} = \mathbf{K} + \Box(\Box p \rightarrow p) \rightarrow \Box p\) is weakly complete with respect to the class of finite strict partial orders (that is, the class of finite irreflexive transitive frames).
%   \end{illustration}

%   \autoref{illu:fc:ML2} is similar in structure to \autoref{illu:fc:logic:CR}.
%   Indeed, both proofs involve constructing a canonical model.
%   The key distinguishing feature of \autoref{illu:fc:ML2}, however, is the difficulty of establishing the canonical model has the desired properties.
%   In particular, the general method I keep in mind for proving the relevant result requires a syntactic proof that \(\vdash_{\mathbf{GL}} \Box p \rightarrow \Box \Box p\).
%   And, as I have failed to recall the relevant syntactic on sufficient occasion, I do not consider the result a \fc{0} from my understanding of modal logic.

%   Hence, the result (plausibly) fails to be a \fc{} from my understanding of modal logic because there is no guarantee that I would provide a proof if I set out to do so.%
%   \footnote{
%     On the other hand, I have completed the relevant proof a sufficient number of times.
%     So, the result is a \fc{0} from whatever premises are associated with my memory.

  Conflicting conclusions.

  \illu{3} may be obtained by taking a proposition-value pairing which conflicts with \fc{}.
  The following is \emph{not} a \fc{}.%
  \footnote{
    However, I suspect the following equation is a \fc{}:
    \[\frac{(3 + \sqrt{3})^{2} + \sqrt{6}^{2} - (2\sqrt{3})^{2}}{2(3 + \sqrt{3})\sqrt{6}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\]
  }

  \begin{illustration}
    \[\frac{(3 + \sqrt{3})^{2} + \sqrt{6}^{2} - (2\sqrt{3})^{2}}{2(3 + \sqrt{3})\sqrt{6}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\]

  {
    \color{red}
    Why this is somewhat interesting.
  }
  However, before turning to the argument for \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support}, it is important to note the limitations of \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support} with respect to \issueConstraint{}.
  For, in order to argue against \issueConstraint{}, need some \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) such that answers \qWhyV{}.
  Answer \qWhyV{} only with dependence.
  Does not follow from \fc{0} that we get dependence.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The argument for \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support} is {\color{red} mostly immediate for ideas regarding support}.

  Goal:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If conclude only if \fc{}, then support, in part, answers \qWhyV{}.
  \end{itemize}

  So, to get answer to \qWhyV{}, need dependency.
  Here, if not \support{} then not \fc{}.
  If not \fc{} then not conclude.

  This is fine, just need to be careful with the counterfactual.
  Relation between \support{} and \fc{} is plain conditional.
  So, it survives any counterfactual changes.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Argument]
  Argument is straightforward.
  Possible support, by assumption.
  Contraposition.
  If not support, then no \fc{}.

  \begin{argument}{prop:fcs-only-if-pot-support}
    Suppose \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{0}.
    Then, \pevent{} in which concludes.
    Now, consider the \pevent{}.
    The culmination of the event, agent concludes.

    So, from~\supportI{}, a \ros{} holds, for the agent.

    Therefore, in whatever sense event is potential, \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) is likewise potential.
  \end{argument}

  For agent, there is no difference between witnessed \ros{} and potential \ros{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  There is room for small worry.
  For, require that agent does an action.
  As the agent does the action, other things could happen.

  Set up so that a soon as agent does action, remote control.

  I don't find this particularly plausible.
  Prefer to think of events to clarify relation to \supportI{}.
  However, reduce to what is currently true of the agent.
  In this sense, know how.

    \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
    \item
      An agent: \vAgent{}
    \item
      A proposition: \(\phi\)
    \item
      A value: \(v\)
    \item
      A \pool{0}: \(\Phi\)

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.)]
      \item
        A potential \ros{} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for \vAgent{}.

    \item[\emph{then}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.), resume]

  \begin{argument}{prop:pot-support-onlyIf-support}
    \supportII{}.
    It is possible for there to be.
    So, we have everything needed.
    Both necessary and sufficient.
    Hence, for agent, \ros{}.

    So, every necessary property that does not involve witnessing.
    But, then, every necessary property.
    Therefore, sufficient.
    For, if not sufficient, then missing a necessary property.
    Contradiction.

    Slight issue, disjunction of properties.
    But, this doesn't change the argument.
    Disjunction.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\paragraph*{Worries}

\begin{note}
  Some doubt.
  Possible to conclude things which conflict.
  No restrictions placed on what an agent may conclude.
  But, this is no worse than \wit[es]{}.
  Possible to have concluded things which conflict.

  Though, nothing depends on this.
  If a simple way to rule out, then would.
  But, it's not so simple.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Could strengthen.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume*=fcCounter]
  \item
    For any proposition \(\phi'\), value \(v'\), and action \(a'\) such that \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi'}{v'}\) from \(\Phi\) after \(a'\) is done:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Either:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
      \item
        \(\phi'\) is \(\phi\) and \(v'\) is \(v\).%
        \footnote{
          In other words, \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) after doing \(a'\).
        }
      \item
        Throughout event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi'}{v'}\) from \(\Phi\), there is some action \(b\) such that \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) after \(b\) is done.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  This is a much stronger condition.
  Not only is it the case that concluding, but remains the case that concluding is available for any other conclusion.

  I like this condition.
  But, it's not of significant help.
  For, there is no guarantee that this extends further.

  Further, borders on normative considerations.
  \autoref{prop:fc:no-arb}, no arbitrary.

  Could say (channelling \cite{Carroll:1895uj}) that the agent \textquote{ca'n't help themselves}.
  However, what this modal amounts to is unclear.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Still, if you prefer something stronger, that's okay.
  There's nothing in what follows that strictly requires that definition of a \fc{} is sufficient.
  Though, some things will need to be restructured.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  Worry.
  \support{2} doesn't rely on witnessing.
  Now, if this goes through, then seems \support{} for any conclusion before making the conclusion.
  However, possible for the agent to reason to different conclusions.
  For, some faulty reasoning.
  Toggle the fault.
  Therefore, \support{} for contradictory conclusions.
\end{note}





% \subsubsection{\wit{3}}
% \label{sec:wit3}

% \begin{note}
%   Note, there is nothing that requires a \fc{} has no prior conclusion.

%   Hence, it may be the case that an agent has a \wit{} for a \fc{}.

%   \begin{illustration}[Modal logic I]
%     \label{illu:fc:logic:CR}
%     The modal system obtained from adding \(\Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p\) as an axiom to \(\mathbf{K}\) is canonical for the Church-Rosser property.

%     I.e. the canonical model \(W,R,V\) for \(\mathbf{K} + \Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p\) is such that \(\forall s,t,u((Rst \land Rsu) \rightarrow \exists v(Rtv \land Ruv))\).
%   \end{illustration}

%   \autoref{illu:fc:logic:CR} is a \fc{} for me.
%   Though, in contrast to the previous \illu{1}, I think there is a reasonable change that \autoref{illu:fc:logic:CR} is not a \fc{} for you.

%   Fairly routine, but two important things.
%   First, grasp on the relevant concepts.
%   If you are unaware of how to construct canonical models for normal modal logics, then unlikely that you will complete the relevant proof.
%   Second, sufficient familiarity with the relevant concepts.
%   The proof is mostly straightforward, though some care needs to be taken in showing that the canonical model for \(\mathbf{K} + \Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p\) has the Church-Rosser property.
%   Proof by contradiction is my preferred way of obtaining the result, but this requires keeping certain facts about the canonical model in mind.%
%   \footnote{
%     A slightly more interesting variation is showing that \(\mathbf{K} + \Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p\) is (strongly) complete with respect to the class of frame which have the Church-Rosser property without detour via a canonical model.
%   }

%   Similar features as \illu{1} given above.

%   In particular, perhaps clearer than \autoref{illu:gist:sudoku} in terms of mistakes.
%   For, go down some wrong path, still will not conclude until counterexample.
%   And, this is very hard to get.

  %     The agent has a good understanding of some formal proof system.

  %     For example, by constructing truth tables, or reasoning about valuation functions.
  %   \item
  %     The agent understands the proof system is sound.
  %     That is to say, the agent understands there exists a proof of some sentence \(A\) \emph{only if} \(A\) is true given an arbitrary valuation.
