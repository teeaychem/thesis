\begin{note}
  Here, \fc{1}.
  Two key things.
  An account of \fc{1}, and connexion between \fc{1} and \ros{1}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If \fc{}, then \ros{}.
  \end{itemize}

  Important idea.
  However, limited.
  Support without witnessing doesn't raise a problem for \issueConstraint{}.
  Rather, support needs to be \emph{why}.

  Main focus is \autoref{cha:sec:fcs-def}.
  What it is for some proposition-value pairing \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) to be a \fc{} from some pool of premises \(\Phi\).
  With the right set-up, \ros{1} --- focus on \autoref{cha:fcs:sec:fcs-support} --- will be simple.

  Progressive, action which is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  Contrast with ability, `ability to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\)'.
  Argue that there is no clear path.
  Though, implicit upshot is reducing ability to progressive (given assumption).

\section{Intuition}
\label{sec:intuition}

\begin{note}
  General term `foregone conclusion' is ambiguous.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Inevitable results of reasoning.
  \item
    Conclusion which has been settled in advance of reasoning.
  \end{itemize}

  Interest is with the second meaning.
  Two examples of general use.

  A clear example of the first meaning is found in~\citeauthor{Machover:1996vu}'s~\citetitle{Machover:1996vu}:

  \begin{quote}
    I have omitted its proof, but added a detailed analysis of the meaning of the lemma and the reason why its proof works. When this is understood, the proof itself becomes a mere technicality, almost a foregone conclusion.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[viii]{Machover:1996vu})}
  \end{quote}

  \citeauthor{Machover:1996vu} is discussing a proof, and whether or not it is inevitable that one would complete the proof (conclude that the relevant theorem is true) after understanding the lemma and why it works.
  There is no relevant sense in which the truth of the theorem has been settled in advance of reasoning.
  Though, as the proof is somewhat difficult,~\citeauthor{Machover:1996vu} only states the proof is `almost' a foregone conclusion.%
  \footnote{
    The proof is question is of the G\"{o}del-Rosser First Incompleteness Theorem.
    (\citeyear[Cf.][226]{Machover:1996vu})
  }%
  \(^{,}\)%
  \footnote{
    For a similar example without qualification, consider the following from~\textcite{Jacquette:2002up}:
    \begin{quote}
    It is nevertheless important to recognize that Russell's evaluation of such sentences as false is predetermined by his existence presuppositional semantics for the ‘existential' quantifier, and by the fact that his logic permits no alternative means of considering the semantic status of sentences ostensibly containing proper names for nonexistent objects.
    This makes it an altogether philosophically foregone conclusion that sentences like ‘Pegasus is winged,' which many logicians would otherwise consider to be true propositions of mythology, are false.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[6]{Jacquette:2002up})}
  \end{quote}
  }

  For an additional example, consider the following from~\citeauthor{Grice:1957vg}'s~\citetitle{Grice:1957vg}:%
  \footnote{
    Same is found in \textcite[219]{Grice:1989uf}.
  }
  \begin{quote}
    He intends the audience's recognition of his intention to produce that response to be effective in producing that response.
    He does not regard it as a foregone conclusion that his action will produce the intended response, whether or not his intention is recognized.\newline
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[385]{Grice:1957vg})}
  \end{quote}

  In this case, the term `foregone conclusion' is embedded under negation, to highlight that the agent in question entertains the possibility that the agent's action will not produce the intended response.

  % \citeauthor{kurufushamashii:2015un}:

  % \begin{quote}
  %   ［どうぜ］\dots Expresses an attitude of resignation or carelessness on the part of the speaker, in the sense that regardless of what s/he does, the conclusion or outcome is foregone and cannot be changed by the will or effort of an individual.%
  %   \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[332--333]{kurufushamashii:2015un})}
  % \end{quote}

  By contrast, the following passage from \textcite{Kadane:1996vu} is an example of the second meaning:

  \begin{quote}
    When can a Bayesian select an hypothesis \emph{H} and design an experiment (or a sequence of experiments) to make certain that, given the experimental outcome(s), the posterior probability of \emph{H} will be greater than its prior probably?
    We discuss an elementary result that establishes sufficient conditions under which this reasoning to a foregone conclusion cannot occur.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[1228]{Kadane:1996vu})}
  \end{quote}

  At issue is whether a Bayesian may chose some hypothesis \emph{H} and then guarantee some increase in probability for \emph{H} by running some experiments.
  So, are there cases in which the Bayesian first chooses a hypothesis \emph{H} and then ensures they reason to an increase in the probability of \emph{H}?
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Our interest is with the first meaning, though narrow.
  To avoid ambiguity with first meaning, write `\fc{0}' rather than `foregone conclusion'.
  That is, the hyphen signifies when we are speaking about the technical term.
\end{note}

\section{\fc{3}}
\label{cha:sec:fcs-def}

\begin{note}[\fc{2} definition]
  We define \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) being a \emph{\fc{0}} as follows:

  \begin{definition}[\fc{3}]
    \label{def:fc}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Proposition: \(\phi\)
      \item
        Value: \(v\)
      \item
        \pool{0}: \(\Phi\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{itemize*}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is a \emph{\fc{0}} for \vAgent{}.
    \end{itemize}
    \emph{If and only if}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=]
    \item
      Both~\ref{def:fc:dia} and~\ref{def:fc:box} are true:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{def:fc:dia}
        There is some action \(a\) such that \vAgent{} may immediately perform such that \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) after \(a\) is done.
      \item
        \label{def:fc:box}
        For any proposition \(\phi'\), value \(v'\), and action \(a'\) such that \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi'}{v'}\) from \(\Phi\) after \(a'\) is done:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item
          Either:
          \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
          \item
            \(\phi'\) is \(\phi\) and \(v'\) is \(v\).%
            \footnote{
              In other words, \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) after doing \(a'\).
            }
          \item
            Throughout event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi'}{v'}\) from \(\Phi\), there is some action \(b\) such that \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) after \(b\) is done.
          \end{enumerate}
        \end{itemize}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  Intuitively, possible to get \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), and no matter what else get from \(\Phi\), \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) remains possible.

  The progressive is key.
  Handful of consequences.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Rules out arbitrary conclusions.
  \item
    Allows for failure of event to happen.
  \item
    Key thing here is that there's no conclusion that we get from immediate action which prevents conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  \item
    ???
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Still, mere possibility is too general.
  There is a possibility in which I immediately obtain a comprehensive understanding of theoretical computer science and settle whether P is equal to NP (or show that the P versus NP problem is undecidable).
  Hence, \fc{1} are defined with respect to the progressive.
\end{note}

\begin{note}

  This is a strong condition.
  The key idea is that the event comes about.

  Intuitively, either concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), or doing something such that after, remains an option to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  Weaker idea:

  It remains possible for the agent to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  This does not means that it needs to be the case that there is an available action.
  This is a nice suggestion.
  Difficulty is sense of possibility.

  Capture with, agent does not conclude any proposition-value pair which is incompatible.
  However, difficulty saying what incompatible amounts to.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is compatible with \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
  \end{itemize}

  For example, got to work on a single problem.

  The point is, that after this action, it is still the case that the agent may go on to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  Breaking this down, initial condition, get concluding.
  The (b) condition then strengthens this.
  Either we're always concluding when reasoning from \(\Phi\) or shift up to concluding.

  Problem, it is possible there's some action, so that void getting \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  However, this is true of any conclusion.
  A conclusion of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) does not ensure that there's no revision.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Key idea.

  It is usually the case that agent may stop.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Second condition.

  This is complex.

  Basic idea, it's always possible to get \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  First part, this gets us an event in which the agent is concluding something else.
  Then, we extend this to the event in which the agent concludes.
  The important is to allow the agent to draw the conclusion.
  At issue is whether get something which blocks \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).

\begin{note}
  Intuition.
  In particular, proofs.

  Before turning to detailed account of \fc{1} in \autoref{cha:sec:fcs-def}, handful of \illu{1}.

  This section consists of two parts:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=]
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:fcs:sec:illu:yes}

    Cases in which \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) (plausibly) \emph{is} a \fc{}.

\subsubsection{\fc{3}}
\label{cha:fcs:sec:illu:yes}

\begin{note}[Chess I]
  \begin{illustration}[Chess I]
    \label{illu:fc:chess:I}
    Consider the following game state:

    \mbox{ }\hfill%
    \begin{adjustbox}{minipage=\linewidth,scale=.9}

    Is possible for White to checkmate in a single move?%

\begin{note}
  \fc{2} of interest:%
  \footnote{
    May also consider whether is possible for White to checkmate in a single move to be a \fc{}, in the sense that it is possible to decide.
    In this case, reduces to solution.
    However, in general decidable may be \fc{} without either answer being a \fc{}.
    In particular, consider an arbitrary first-order formula.
    First-order logic is decidable, however determining which is a different matter.
  }
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    It is possible for White to checkmate in a single move.
  \end{itemize}
  Clearest way is to do the reasoning, and then observe would not have made a different conclusion.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Consider different pieces.
  If like me, first move (\wmove{Qe8}) does not result in checkmate.
  However, do not conclude that it is not possible.
  Other moves to check (e.g\ \wmove{Qf6}, \wmove{Re4}, \wmove{h4}, etc.).

  At some point, consider\wmove{Qh8}, which results in checkmate.

  Simple.
  Key observation is that although not immediate, conclude it is possible for White to checkmate in a single move.
  And, would not have concluded otherwise, or indeed concluded something incompatible which would have prevented (for example, that it is possible for Black's king to move to b8 between the two rooks.)

  Perhaps get bored or distracted, and didn't conclude.
  Remains the case that \fc{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Propositional logic generalised]
  Second option, general type of \scen{0} in two ways:

  Soundness:

  \begin{quote}
    Make sure all the rules are sound, whether these are basic or derived rules.
  \end{quote}

  Semantic entailment:

  \begin{illustration}[Propositional logic generalised]
    \label{illu:sketch:prop-logic}
    Suppose an agent has a good grasp of propositional logic.
    In particular:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The agent has a good understanding of some formal proof system.
      For example, some Fitch-style system.
    \item
      The agent has a good understanding of some method to construct semantic proofs.
      For example, by constructing truth tables, or reasoning about valuation functions.
    \item
      The agent understands the proof system is sound.
      That is to say, the agent understands there exists a proof of some sentence \(A\) \emph{only if} \(A\) is true given an arbitrary valuation.
    \end{itemize}
    The agent constructs a proof of \(A\).

    Given the agent's understanding of propositional logic, the agent observes:
    \begin{quote}
      The construction is a proof of \(A\) \emph{only if} \(A\) is true given an arbitrary valuation.
    \end{quote}
  \end{illustration}

  Intuitively, if the agent were to reason about whether \(A\) is true given an arbitrary valuation and failed to conclude \(A\) is true given an arbitrary valuation, then the agent would not conclude the construction is a proof of \(A\).

  If were to go for semantic, then by soundness, works out.
\end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   \begin{illustration}[Modal logic I]
%     \label{illu:fc:logic:CR}
%     The modal system obtained from adding \(\Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p\) as an axiom to \(\mathbf{K}\) is canonical for the Church-Rosser property.

%     I.e. the canonical model \(W,R,V\) for \(\mathbf{K} + \Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p\) is such that \(\forall s,t,u((Rst \land Rsu) \rightarrow \exists v(Rtv \land Ruv))\).
%   \end{illustration}

%   \autoref{illu:fc:logic:CR} is a \fc{} for me.
%   Though, in contrast to the previous \illu{1}, I think there is a reasonable change that \autoref{illu:fc:logic:CR} is not a \fc{} for you.

%   Fairly routine, but two important things.
%   First, grasp on the relevant concepts.
%   If you are unaware of how to construct canonical models for normal modal logics, then unlikely that you will complete the relevant proof.
%   Second, sufficient familiarity with the relevant concepts.
%   The proof is mostly straightforward, though some care needs to be taken in showing that the canonical model for \(\mathbf{K} + \Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p\) has the Church-Rosser property.
%   Proof by contradiction is my preferred way of obtaining the result, but this requires keeping certain facts about the canonical model in mind.%
%   \footnote{
%     A slightly more interesting variation is showing that \(\mathbf{K} + \Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p\) is (strongly) complete with respect to the class of frame which have the Church-Rosser property without detour via a canonical model.
%   }

%   Similar features as \illu{1} given above.

%   In particular, perhaps clearer than \autoref{illu:gist:sudoku} in terms of mistakes.
%   For, go down some wrong path, still will not conclude until counterexample.
%   And, this is very hard to get.

  Result of deductive reasoning with more-or-less explicit collection of rules.

  These characteristics are not (nor any other shared characteristic) required.
  Clear account of why \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is a \fc{}.

  What is required is available information, conclusion, no divergence.
\end{note}

% \begin{note}[Non-deductive \illu{1}]
%   The following is a simple \illu{} involving non-deductive conclusion:
%   \begin{illustration}[Sunny days]
%     It's mid summer in the Bay Area.
%   \end{illustration}
%   For me, it is a \fc{} that it will not rain tomorrow.

%   Of course, I recognise there is a possibility that it \emph{may} rain tomorrow.
%   However, I haven't checked the weather forecast, and with no information to the contrary I see no way of \emph{failing} to conclude that tomorrow will be sunny.
%   You may object, and perhaps I am too quick to conclude that it will not rain tomorrow.

%   Still, no matter the gravitas with which I consider the possibility of rain, I am sufficiently committed to some uniformity principle that the principle, combined with past experience, lead me to conclude that it will be sunny tomorrow.
%   Hence, prior to reasoning, the truth of the proposition is a \fc{}.%
%   \footnote{
%     Same extends to various skeptical hypotheses.
%     Entertain the possibility that there is no external world, but nothing that prevents me from concluding that there is an external world.
%     Though, your perspective on such issues may differ.
%   }

%   Note, whether or not it rains tomorrow has no bearing on whether or not it is a \fc{} (for me) that it will not rain tomorrow.
%   What happens in the future has no direct bearing on what I may (or may not) conclude in the present.%

\begin{note}[Poppies]
  We conclude the \illu{1} with a slightly more speculative \illu{0}:
  \begin{illustration}[Poppies]
    \mbox{ }
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{quote}
      Was Tarquinius Superbus in seinem Garten mit den Mohnköpfen sprach, verstand der Sohn, aber nicht der Bote.

  The above quite is from the epigraph to~\citeauthor{Kierkegaard:1983ta}'s \hyperlink{cite.Kierkegaard:1983ta}{Fear and Trembling}.
  \hyperlink{cite.Kierkegaard:1983ta}{H.\ Hong and E.\ Hong} detail the relevant background:

  \begin{quote}
    When the son of Tarquinius Superbus had craftily gotten Gabii in his power, he sent a messenger to his father asking what he should do with the city.
    Tarquinius, not trusting the messenger, gave no reply but took him into the garden, where with his cane he cut off the flowers of the tallest poppies.
    The son understood from this that he should eliminate the leading men of the city.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[339]{Kierkegaard:1983ta})}
  \end{quote}
  That he should eliminate the leading men of the city was a \fc{0} for Superbus' son, but not for the messenger.
  Or, at the very least Superbus \emph{expected} the command to eliminate the leading men of the city to be a \fc{} for his son.

    }
  \end{illustration}
  It is plausible that I would not conclude that it is possible for Black to checkmate in four moves or conversely.

  Though perhaps the bound is too low.
  If I gave it my all and attempted to work my way though all the possibilities present it may be the case that I conclude either way.
  Still, there are a lot of moves to consider, and I lack any intuition about which is correct.%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Emms:2000aa} provides the following solution:

% \begin{note}[ML II]
%   \begin{illustration}[Modal logic II]
%     \label{illu:fc:ML2}
%     The modal system \(\mathbf{GL} = \mathbf{K} + \Box(\Box p \rightarrow p) \rightarrow \Box p\) is weakly complete with respect to the class of finite strict partial orders (that is, the class of finite irreflexive transitive frames).
%   \end{illustration}

%   \autoref{illu:fc:ML2} is similar in structure to \autoref{illu:fc:logic:CR}.
%   Indeed, both proofs involve constructing a canonical model.
%   The key distinguishing feature of \autoref{illu:fc:ML2}, however, is the difficulty of establishing the canonical model has the desired properties.
%   In particular, the general method I keep in mind for proving the relevant result requires a syntactic proof that \(\vdash_{\mathbf{GL}} \Box p \rightarrow \Box \Box p\).
%   And, as I have failed to recall the relevant syntactic on sufficient occasion, I do not consider the result a \fc{0} from my understanding of modal logic.

%   Hence, the result (plausibly) fails to be a \fc{} from my understanding of modal logic because there is no guarantee that I would provide a proof if I set out to do so.%
%   \footnote{
%     On the other hand, I have completed the relevant proof a sufficient number of times.

    \citeauthor{Barker:1975un} also, as far as I can tell, endorses the principles.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*), ref=(\Alph*), noitemsep]
    \item
      \label{Barker:1975un:A}
      If \emph{S} knows whether \emph{p} and \emph{S} believes that \emph{p}, then \emph{p}.
    \item
      \label{Barker:1975un:B}
      If \emph{S} knows whether \emph{p} and \emph{S} believes that not-\emph{p}, then not-\emph{p}.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[281]{Barker:1975un})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{illustration}
  I suggest neither principle is \fc{}, as you may conclude counterexamples exist to both.%
  \footnote{
    For example, consider two agents, \emph{A} and \emph{B} playing chess where each move is timed.
  It's the end game, and \emph{A} believes that \emph{B} has a winning strategy.
  Further, \emph{A} (plausibly) knows whether \emph{B} has a winning strategy.
  For, an observer has determined whether or not \emph{B} has a winning strategy, and \emph{A} is capable of tracing the reasoning of the observer.
  So, if \ref{Barker:1975un:A} holds then \emph{B} has a winning strategy.
  But, the observer knows that \emph{B} \emph{does not} have a winning strategy, and \emph{A}'s belief is mistaken.

    \color{red}
    Why this is somewhat interesting.
  }
  However, before turning to the argument for \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support}, it is important to note the limitations of \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support} with respect to \issueConstraint{}.
  For, in order to argue against \issueConstraint{}, need some \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) such that answers \qWhyV{}.
  Answer \qWhyV{} only with dependence.
  Does not follow from \fc{0} that we get dependence.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The argument for \autoref{prop:fcs-only-if-support} is {\color{red} mostly immediate for ideas regarding support}.

  \begin{goal}
    If conclude only if \fc{}, then support, in part, answers \qWhyV{}.
  \end{goal}

  So, to get answer to \qWhyV{}, need dependency.
  Here, if not \support{} then not \fc{}.
  If not \fc{} then not conclude.

  This is fine, just need to be careful with the counterfactual.
  Relation between \support{} and \fc{} is plain conditional.
  So, it survives any counterfactual changes.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Argument]
  Argument is straightforward.
  Possible support, by assumption.
  Contraposition.
  If not support, then no \fc{}.
\end{note}

\subsection{Potential \ros{1}}

\begin{note}
  Start with the following proposition.
  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:fcs-only-if-pot-support}
    \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
    \item
      An agent: \vAgent{}
    \item
      A proposition: \(\phi\)
    \item
      A value: \(v\)
    \item
      A \pool{0}: \(\Phi\)
    \item
      \mbox{ }
    \end{itemize*}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.)]
      \item
        \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{0}, for \vAgent{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{then}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.), resume]
      \item
        A potential \ros{} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for \vAgent{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:fcs-only-if-pot-support}
    Suppose \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{0}.
    Then, \pevent{} in which concludes.
    Now, consider the \pevent{}.
    The culmination of the event, agent concludes.

    So, from~\supportI{}, a \ros{} holds, for the agent.

    Therefore, in whatever sense event is potential, \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) is likewise potential.
  \end{argument}

  For agent, there is no difference between witnessed \ros{} and potential \ros{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  There is room for small worry.
  For, require that agent does an action.
  As the agent does the action, other things could happen.

  Set up so that a soon as agent does action, remote control.

  I don't find this particularly plausible.
  Prefer to think of events to clarify relation to \supportI{}.
  However, reduce to what is currently true of the agent.
  In this sense, know how.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \emph{Potential} \ros{}, but it does not follow that there is a \ros{}, for the agent.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:pot-support-onlyIf-support}
    \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
    \item
      An agent: \vAgent{}
    \item
      A proposition: \(\phi\)
    \item
      A value: \(v\)
    \item
      A \pool{0}: \(\Phi\)
    \item
      \mbox{ }
    \end{itemize*}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.)]
      \item
        A potential \ros{} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for \vAgent{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{then}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*.), resume]
      \item
        A \ros{0} holds between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\), for \vAgent{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:pot-support-onlyIf-support}
    \supportII{}.
    It is possible for there to be.
    So, we have everything needed.
    Both necessary and sufficient.
    Hence, for agent, \ros{}.

    So, every necessary property that does not involve witnessing.
    But, then, every necessary property.
    Therefore, sufficient.
    For, if not sufficient, then missing a necessary property.
    Contradiction.

    Slight issue, disjunction of properties.
    But, this doesn't change the argument.
    Disjunction.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  Worry.
  \support{2} doesn't rely on witnessing.
  Now, if this goes through, then seems \support{} for any conclusion before making the conclusion.
  However, possible for the agent to reason to different conclusions.
  For, some faulty reasoning.
  Toggle the fault.
  Therefore, \support{} for contradictory conclusions.
\end{note}

% \subsubsection{\wit{3}}
% \label{sec:wit3}

% \begin{note}
%   Note, there is nothing that requires a \fc{} has no prior conclusion.

%   Hence, it may be the case that an agent has a \wit{} for a \fc{}.

%   \begin{proposition}[\wit{3} for \fc{1}]
%     \label{prop:wit-for-fc}
%     Possible for \wit{} from \fc{}.
%   \end{proposition}

%   \begin{argument}{prop:wit-for-fc}
%       Immediate by def of \wit{}.
%     \end{argument}
%   \end{note}


\section{`Foregone-concluding'}
\label{sec:fc-progressive}

\begin{note}
  So, action such that would be concluding.
  On understanding of the progressive, no matter what happens, still conclude.
  Might need to get `lucky' with action.
  However, start then path to the conclusion.

  This `luck' is limited.
  Nothing conflicting.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Worry, jumping to conclusions.
  But, in this case, \pevent{} in which agent concludes that step of reasoning is bad.
  Hence, incompatible.
