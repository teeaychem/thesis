\begin{note}
  This chapter introduces the core idea of this document:
  Some \prop{0}-\val{0} pair \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) being a \emph{\fc{}} from some \pool{0} \(\Phi\).

  Paraphrased, \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) is a \fc{} from \(\Phi\) for an agent just in case there is a possible event in which the agent to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) and \evals{} every \prop{} in \(\Phi\) with its corresponding \val{} prior to the event.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The idea of a \fc{0} is central to the way in which we characterise \ros{1}, and the way in which we generate counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
  However, \fc{1} as defined are compatible with \issueInclusion{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The first section of this chapter defines \fc{1}.
  The second section of this chapter provide a handful of \illu{1} of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairs which are \fc{1} and \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairs which are not.
\end{note}

\section{Definition}
\label{cha:fcs:def}

\begin{note}[\fc{2} definition]
  \begin{definition}[\fc{3}]%
    \label{def:fc}%
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) is a \emph{\fc{0}} from \(\Phi\) for \vAgent{} throughout an event \(\ed{}\).
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      For some partition of \(\edn{}\) into sub-events \(\edn{1}, \dots, \edn{k}\) there are descriptions \(d_{i}\) such that \(\ed{i}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} may immediately do action \(a_{i}\) and conditions \ref{def:fc:act} and \ref{def:fc:result} are true:
      %
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., ref=\Alph*, series=fcCounter]
        %
      \item
        \label{def:fc:act}
        The event \(\ed{i\sharp}\) in which \vAgent{} does \(a_{i}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
        %
      \item
        \label{def:fc:result}
        For each \prop{0}-\val{0} pair \(\pv{\phi'}{v'}\) in \(\Phi\), \vAgent{} \evals{} \(\phi'\) as having value \(v'\) prior to doing \(a_{i}\).
        %
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  The core idea of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) being a \fc{} from \(\Phi\) is the availability of an action such that an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is in progress when the agent does the action.

  In order to easily connect \fc{1} to other ideas in this document, \fc{1} are defined with respect to events, and in order to allow for the possibility of distinct actions being done, the existence of a relevant action is stated with respect to sub-events of the event.
  Though, for ease of expression we talk as through there is a common available action through all sub-events of an event when discussing \fc{1}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  As defined, \fc{1} concern the availability of an action such that an agent is concluding.
  The relevant \emph{conclusion} intuitively follows from Condition~\ref{def:fc:act} and \assuPP{}.
  For, by \assuPP{}, if an agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) there is a possible event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  The sense in which the relevant conclusion \emph{is forgone} follows from \ref{def:fc:act} and \ref{def:fc:result}.

  From Condition~\ref{def:fc:act}, something prior to conclusion is sufficient to ensure an action such that an event in which the agent concludes is in progress.
  And, from Condition~\ref{def:fc:result}, when the agent does not require any novel \evals{} to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
  `Novel' in the sense that \eval{} is not obtained from present \eval{1}.%
  \footnote{
    There is a slight problem.

    For, it may be the case that when the agent does the action, something changes.
    For example, suppose an agent has the option to attempt to make some conclusion, and so long as the agent makes an attempt, the agent is given additional deductive powers.
    Whether the conclusion is really `foregone' in the intuitive sense appealed to here is unclear.
    For, the conclusion may not follow from the relevant \pool{} with respect to the agent as they are.

    However, I do not think it is worth complicating the definition of a \fc{} to rule out this possibility.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Given the above, our technical term `\fc{}' associates with (by is not an analysis of) a sense of the common term `foregone conclusion' as an expected result of reasoning.%
  \footnote{
    For example:

    \begin{quote}
      [\dots] Russell's evaluation of such sentences as false is predetermined by his existence presuppositional semantics for the ‘existential' quantifier, and by the fact that his logic permits no alternative means of considering the semantic status of sentences ostensibly containing proper names for nonexistent objects.
      This makes it an altogether philosophically foregone conclusion that sentences like ‘Pegasus is winged,' which many logicians would otherwise consider to be true propositions of mythology, are false.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[6]{Jacquette:2002up})}
    \end{quote}

    \noindent \citeauthor{Jacquette:2002up} is discussing what follows from~\citeauthor{Russell:1905aa}'s analysis of definite descriptions.
    Specifically, from \citeauthor{Russell:1905aa}'s analysis it follows \propI{Pegasus is winged} is \valI{False}.
    (There are no four-legged winged mammals, etc.)
  }
  This sense of the term `foregone conclusion' contrasts against a sense with which a \prop{0}-\val{0} pair has been decided in advance of reasoning.%
  \footnote{
    For example:
    \begin{quote}
      When can a Bayesian select an hypothesis \emph{H} and design an experiment (or a sequence of experiments) to make certain that, given the experimental outcome(s), the posterior probability of \emph{H} will be greater than its prior probably?
      We discuss an elementary result that establishes sufficient conditions under which this reasoning to a foregone conclusion cannot occur.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[1228]{Kadane:1996vu})}
    \end{quote}
  }
  And, a sense in which a forgone conclusion is some unavoidable state of affairs.%
  \footnote{
    For example:
    \begin{quote}
      ［どうぜ］[\dots] Expresses an attitude of resignation or carelessness on the part of the speaker, in the sense that regardless of what s/he does, the conclusion or outcome is foregone and cannot be changed by the will or effort of an individual.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[332--333]{kurufushamashii:2015un})}
    \end{quote}
    See also \citeauthor{Grice:1957vg}'s discussion of intention recognition (\citeyear[385]{Grice:1957vg}/\citeyear[219]{Grice:1989uf}), and \citeauthor{Machover:1996vu}'s preface of their approach to the G\"{o}del-Rosser First Incompleteness Theorem (\citeyear[viii]{Machover:1996vu}).

\paragraph{Illustration 1}

\begin{note}
  \begin{scenario}[\cite[9]{Dudeney:1995aa}]
    \label{scen:fc:chick}%
    Three chickens and one duck sold for as much as two geese; one chicken, two ducks, and three geese were sold together for \$25.00.
    What was the price of each bird in an exact number of dollars?
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  With respect to \autoref{scen:fc:chick}, the \fc{} of interest is the solution to the puzzle:
  %
  \begin{enumerate}[label=C\thescenarioCounter., ref=C\thescenarioCounter]
  \item
    \label{scen:fc:chick:c}
    \pv{\propI{The price of a chicken was \$2.00, for a duck \$4.00, and for a goose \$5.00}}{\valI{True}}
  \end{enumerate}
  %
  Intuitively, \ref{scen:fc:chick:c} is a \fc{} from some \pool{} \(\Phi_{\ref{scen:fc:chick:c}}\) which characterises the agent's experience with both algebra and recasting natural language problems as algebraic problems.
  Given the agent's experience with both algebra and recasting natural language problems as algebraic problems is sufficient to solve the puzzle.

  For, after reading the puzzle:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Attempting to solve the puzzle is some action the agent may immediately do.
    And, both \ref{scen:fc:chick:ex:a} and \ref{scen:fc:chick:ex:b} are true:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
    \item
      \label{scen:fc:chick:ex:a}
      When the agent attempts to solve the puzzle, the agent is solving the puzzle.
    \item
      \label{scen:fc:chick:ex:b}
      The agent's experience with both algebra and recasting natural language problems as algebraic problems holds prior to the agent attempting to solve the puzzle and the details of the puzzle.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
  %
  In general, puzzles like that of \autoref{scen:fc:chick} are a simple way of identifying \fc{1}.
  For, the puzzle is designed such that, given appropriate background, the agent has all the information required to solve the puzzle, once read.
  And, though we limit ourselves to a single example from \citeauthor{Dudeney:1995aa}'s \citetitle{Dudeney:1995aa} the book contains roughly 500 or so puzzles for which there is plausible an associated \fc{0} from some \pool{} given a reader with the sufficient background.%
  \footnote{
    Some require \evals{} you may not have.
    For example, 527 on page 217 assumes knowledge of the size of some American coins.
    And others do not have well-defined answers, such 523 on page 215.
  }

  Still, I have no detailed account of the way in which an agent concludes \ref{scen:fc:chick:c}.
  For, there is no general strategy.
  It is straightforward to write \(3c + 1d = 2g\) and \(1c + 2d + 3g = 25\), multiply the first equation by \(3\), the right equation by \(2\), and then substitute and simplify.
  However, figuring out which thing, out of all the other things one may do, involves some \emph{je ne sais quoi}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Chess I]
  To motivate that an agent is concluding some \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{} after performing an action in detail we turn to chess puzzles and exhaustive search.

  \begin{scenario}[\citeauthor{Emms:2000aa}' Puzzle 113 (\citeyear[33]{Emms:2000aa})]%
    \label{illu:fc:chess:I}%
    \mbox{ }\hfill%
    \begin{adjustbox}{minipage=\linewidth,scale=0.75}
      \centering
      \newchessgame[
      setwhite={pa2,pb2,pc2,pd3,pf2,pg3,ra1,re1,bd4,kg1,qe5},
      addblack={ra8,pa7,ba6,pb5,rc8,pd5,pf7,kg8,qg4,ph7,ph4},
      ]%
      \setchessboard{showmover=false}%
      \chessboard
    \end{adjustbox}%
    \label{fig:chess:easy}%
    \hfill\mbox{ }

    \begin{center}
      Is possible for White to checkmate in a single move?
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{scenario}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The \prop{0}-\val{0} pair of interest is:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=C\thescenarioCounter., ref=C\thescenarioCounter]
  \item
    \label{illu:fc:chess:I:c}
    \pv{\propI{It is possible for White to checkmate in a single move}}{\valI{True}}
  \end{enumerate}
  %
  Consider a \pool{} which contains \prop{0}-\val{0} pairs which capture rules of chess and the game state.
  \pool{} prior to reasoning.
  For, the rules of chess are independent, and do not need to start reasoning in order to inspect setup of puzzle.

  The broad motivation for \ref{illu:fc:chess:I:c} being a \fc{} from \(\Phi_{\ref{illu:fc:chess:I:c}}\) parallels the discussion of  \ref{scen:fc:chick:c} being a \fc{} from \(\Phi_{\ref{scen:fc:chick:c}}\), above.

  Assume the relevant action is `begin an attempt to solve \citeauthor{Emms:2000aa}' Puzzle 113 by exhaustive search'.
  And, consider following (motivated) conditionals:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
  \item
    \label{illu:fc:chess:I:cond:1}
    If the agent picks \wmove{Qh8}, then agent is concluding \ref{illu:fc:chess:I:c} from \(\Phi_{\ref{illu:fc:chess:I:c}}\).
    \smallskip

    By assumption, the agent has a basic understanding of chess and is motivated.
    And, as the agent needs to verify \wmove{Qh8} in checkmate, the agent will.
  \item
    \label{illu:fc:chess:I:cond:2}
    If the agent picks a move other than \wmove{Qh8} then after some reasoning the agent picks a novel move.%
    \smallskip

    By parallel reasoning.
    For, the agent needs only verify the move other than \wmove{Qh8} fails to result in checkmate, and then pick some other move.
    The agent will verify, given their understanding of chess.
    And, the agent will pick some novel move as their strategy is exhaustive search.
  \end{enumerate}
  %
  Now, whichever move the agent picks, either \ref{illu:fc:chess:I:cond:1} or \ref{illu:fc:chess:I:cond:2} is true.
  And, as there are finitely many moves for the agent to pick, \ref{illu:fc:chess:I:cond:1} will (eventually be true).
  Hence, as an event in which the agent concludes \ref{illu:fc:chess:I:c} is in progress when \ref{illu:fc:chess:I:cond:1} is true, an event in which the agent concludes \ref{illu:fc:chess:I:c} is (also) in progress when \ref{illu:fc:chess:I:cond:2} is true.
\end{note}



\paragraph{Illustration 3}

\begin{note}[Chess II]
  Still, a basic understanding of chess does not entail any chess puzzle is a \fc{}.
  For example, consider \citeauthor{Emms:2000aa}' Puzzle 150:

  \begin{scenario}[\citeauthor{Emms:2000aa}' Puzzle 150 (\citeyear[33]{Emms:2000aa})]%
    \label{illu:fc:chess:II}%
    \mbox{ }\hfill%
    \begin{adjustbox}{minipage=\linewidth,scale=0.75}
      \centering
      \newchessgame[
      setwhite={ka5,pa3,pb4,pc4,pe5,pf6,bg5,bh5},
      addblack={pa6,pb7,pc6,pe6,pf7,kc7,nd7,nd4},
      ]%
      \setchessboard{showmover=false}%
      \chessboard
    \end{adjustbox}%
    \label{fig:chess:intro}%
    \hfill\mbox{ }

    \begin{center}
      It is possible for Black to checkmate in four moves?
    \end{center}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  The conclusion of interest is:
  % 
  \begin{enumerate}[label=C\thescenarioCounter., ref=C\thescenarioCounter]
  \item
    \label{illu:fc:chess:II:c}
    \pv{\propI{Black checkmates in four moves}}{\valI{Possible}}
  \end{enumerate}
  % 
  The difference between \autoref{illu:fc:chess:II} and \autoref{illu:fc:chess:I} is the difficulty of the puzzle.%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Emms:2000aa} suggests:
    \textquote{%
      \variation{1... Nb6!}%
      (threatening \variation{2... Nb3\#})%
      \variation{2. b5}%
      (or \variation{2. Bd1 Nxc4+} \variation{3. Ka4 b5\#})%
      \variation{2... c5!}%
      \variation{3. bxa6 Nxc4+}%
      \variation{4. Ka4 b5\#}%
      \textbf{(0-1)}%
    }
    (\citeyear[46]{Emms:2000aa}).
  }
  And, a basic understanding of chess does not imply the capacity to work through a complex sequence of moves in the relevant situation.%
  \footnote{
    I gave up after fifteen minutes or so.
    Hence it seems~\ref{illu:fc:chess:II:c} was not a \fc{} for me.
  }\(^{,}\)%
  \footnote{
    An agent may get guess a suitable sequence of four moves and verify they work, but if an agent is guessing, there is nothing to guarantee there next guess is correct.
    Hence, in this case \ref{illu:fc:chess:II:c} likewise fails to be a \fc{} from some \pool{}.
    And, more generally we define \fc{0} in terms of events in progress in part to rule out possible conclusions of this kind.
  }
  And, if the agent lacks the capacity to work through the relevant complex sequence, then an event in which the agent concludes \ref{illu:fc:chess:II:c} from some \pool{} is not in progress.
  Likewise, the agent may have the relevant capacity but have no interest in chess puzzles, be too resource constrained.
  % Still, though \ref{illu:fc:chess:II:c} may fail to be a \fc{} from \(\Phi_{\ref{illu:fc:chess:II:c}}\), \ref{illu:fc:chess:II:c} may be a \fc{} from some distinct \pool{} \(\Phi_{\ref{illu:fc:chess:II:c}}'\) but be a \fc{} from some distinct \pool{} \(\Phi'\) as the agent prefers reasoning from \(\Phi'\) as opposed to \(\Phi\).
  % Using a chess engine to solve chess problems seems to defeat the purpose of thinking about the problem, but I almost always prefer to use a calculator for mildly complex arithmetic such as \(4^{4!}\) over my own understanding of arithmetic.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Illustration 4}

\begin{note}
  In some cases it is possible to easily point to something which prevents an agent from drawing a conclusion.
  For example, consider the following story:

  \begin{scenario}[A copper kettle --- \cite[62]{Freud:1960wx}]%
    \label{illu:kettle}%
    A.\ borrowed a copper kettle from B.\ and after he had returned it was sued by B.\ because the kettle now had a big hole in it which made it unusable.
    His defence was:
    ``%
    First, I never borrowed a kettle from B.\ at all;
    secondly, the kettle had a hole in it already when I got it from him;
    and thirdly, I gave him back the kettle undamaged.%
    ''
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  Consider an agent who has listened to A.'s defence.
  The conclusion of interest is:
  % 
  \begin{enumerate}[label=C\thescenarioCounter., ref=C\thescenarioCounter]
  \item
    \label{illu:kettle:c}
    \pv{\propI{A.'s defence is testimony}}{\valI{True}}
  \end{enumerate}
  % 
  Further, suppose the agent is committed to the following principle:%
  \footnote{
    Motivated by the observations that
    \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\alph*), ref=(\alph*)]
    \item A.\ has provided testimony only if what A.\ has said is true.
      And,
    \item what A.\ has said is true only if the three points of A.'s defence are jointly consistent.
    \end{enumerate*}
  }
  % 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A.\ has provided testimony \emph{only if} if the three points of A.'s defence are jointly consistent.
  \end{itemize}
  % 
  Then, \ref{illu:kettle:c} is not a \fc{} from any \pool{}, as it is not possible for the agent to conclude \pv{\propI{The three points of A.'s defence are jointly consistent}}{\valI{True}}.
  Indeed, it seems clear \pv{\propI{The three points of A.'s defence are jointly \emph{in}consistent}}{\valI{True}} is a \fc{} from any relevant \pool{}.
  For, it takes only a moments reflection to observe it is not possible to return a kettle one has not borrowed.
\end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   Likewise, \propM{0 = 1}, value \valI{True}, and a \pool{} which captures a common understanding of arithmetic during their normal workday.
%   For, conflicts with a standard understanding of the natural numbers.

%   Of course, mistakes happen, and one may conclude some contradiction is true.
%   However, there is a distinction between a mistake which happens when an agent concludes, and a mistake present in the agent's understanding of some subject matter.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   Still, nothing prevents two conflicting \prop{0}-\val{0} pairs from being \fc{1}.
%   We argued \autoref{illu:kettle:c} is not a \fc{} due to requiring testimony is consistent.
%   However, an agent may be a little more flexible, and willing to ignore whether testimony is consistent if they are swayed by rhetoric.
%   Hence, 
%   For example, consistency of testimony, but may also be swayed by A.'s rhetoric.
%   So, focus on content, or focus on presentation.
%   Different actions, different conclusions.

%   A \fc{} only captures possible conclusion.
%   Nothing in particular hangs on this.
%   We refrain from placing additional constraints on \fc{1} in order to keep the definition of a \fc{} simple.
%   If you prefer to strengthen definition with justification, etc. that's okay.
%   And, we implicitly assume \fc{1} are sensible.
% \end{note}

\paragraph{Illustration 5}

\begin{note}
  Finally, in some cases a \prop{0}-\val{0} pair may fail to be a \fc{} from a specific \pool{} due to the absence of some \prop{0}-\val{0} pairs.

  \begin{scenario}[Stag hunt]%
    \label{fc:sh}%
    Two hunters may hunt either stag or hare.
    It is possible for each hunter to capture hare alone, but to capture a stag requires cooperation.
    Hence, the hunters expect a payoff for hunting hare regardless of what the other does, but they one expect a payoff for hunting hare if they do so together.
    And, as a stag is much larger than a hare, the expected payoff for a hunting stag (together) is higher than hunting hare.
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  The conclusion of interest is:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=C\thescenarioCounter., ref=C\thescenarioCounter]
  \item
    \label{fc:sh:c}
    \pv{\propI{Hunt stag}}{\valI{Do}}
  \end{enumerate}
  % 
  \ref{fc:sh:c} is plausibly fails to be a \fc{} for either hunter without information about what the other hunter is inclined to do, as there is not expected payoff for hunting stag alone.%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Skyrms:2004aa} expands:
    \begin{quote}
      It is clear that a pessimist, who always expects the worst, would hunt hare [and] a cautious player, who was so uncertain that he thought the other player was as likely to do one thing as another, would also hunt hare.
      [\dots]
      That is not to say that rational players could not coordinate on the stag hunt equilibrium that gives them both a better payoff, but it is to say that they need a measure of trust to do so.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[3]{Skyrms:2004aa})}
    \end{quote}
    And, we may say \pv{\propI{Hunt hare}}{\valI{Do}} is a \fc{} for the both a pessimist and cautious player.
  }
\end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   \color{red}

%   Likewise \propI{The headline of tomorrow's newspaper contains an even number of vowels}, value \valI{True}, and any \pool{} which includes \prop{0}-\val{0} pairs available to the agent.
%   For  an agent who has no information about tomorrows newspaper.

\section*{Summary}


\begin{note}
  This chapter defined \fc{1} and provide a handful of \illu{1} of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairs such that the \prop{0}-\val{0} pair is (not) a \fc{} from the \pool{}.
  Additional \illu{1} of \fc{1} follow in later chapters.
