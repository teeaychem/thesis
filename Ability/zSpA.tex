\begin{note}
  So, here, we've stated everything from the agent's perspective.
  Here, outline two related principles termed `\ptivity{}' and `\ptivityQ{}' which allow recasting in terms of arbitrary attitudes.

  Also, expand on why perspective.
\end{note}

\section{\ptivity{2} and \ptivityQ{2}}
\label{cha:zSpA:sec:difficulty}

\begin{note}[Basic idea]
  Distinguish between:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(\phi\) having value \(v\) from agent's perspective.
  \end{itemize}
  And:
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(\phi\) \(\{\) seems, being believed to have, imagining, misrepresented \dots \(\}\) to have value \(v\) from agent's perspective.
  \end{itemize}

  In the second case, some qualifier.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
    Motivating reasons are psychological states of the agent.

    The statement

    \item%
      \emph{A}'s reason for \(\phi\)-ing was that \emph{p}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*), resume, nosep]
    \item
      \emph{A} believed that \emph{p}.
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*), resume, nosep]
    \item
      \emph{A}'s reason for \(\phi\)-ing was that \emph{A} believed that \emph{p}.%

  \end{quote}
  As \citeauthor{Dancy:2000aa} observes, this argument is not obviously valid.
  However, not too interested in the argument.

  \begin{quote}
    Its conclusion is not that /Vs reason for <p-ing was his believing that p, but that his reason was that he believed that p.
    \dots
    [the] reason [the argument] `discovers' is not itself a psychological state of the agent but the `fact' that the agent was in such a state.

   \citeauthor{Dancy:2000aa} highlights misunderstanding of conclusion.

\begin{note}
  As expressed by \citeauthor{Collins:1997wn} (\citeyear{Collins:1997wn}):
  \begin{quote}
    The perspective of the agent, when rightly interpreted, is not a call for introspectible deteterminants of action.
    It is a reminder that it is objective circumstances \emph{as apprehended by the agent} that are relevant.
    The perspective is not the subject matter.
    An agent makes statements about the objective circumstances as he understands them.
    This qualification: `as he understands them' is not a shift to the mental realm.%

  \phantlabel{dancy-to-return}
  Interest here is with the distinction.

  The general argument \citeauthor{Dancy:2000aa} makes is more delicate.
  Question about whether \(\phi\) having value \(v\) explains, from the agent's perspective.
  Distinct from Question about whether \(\phi\) having value \(v\) from the agent's perspective, explains.

  For the moment, our interest is whether there is a difference with respect to positive answers to \qzS{}.
  If no difference, then broader issues concern statement of the question, rather than answers to the question.

\begin{note}
  Build up slowly.

  First, \autoref{cha:zSpA:sec:ptivity}, basic principle, indirect link to \autoref{prop:PWEs}.
  Second, \autoref{cha:zSpA:sec:ptivityq}, expand on the basic principle, direct link to \autoref{prop:PWEs}.

  Then, \autoref{cha:zSpA:sec:revisiting-arguments}, revisit arguments.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Argument is sound.

  However, highlight an important aspect of the argument.

  Positive answers to \qzS{} require \ptivity{} to hold.

  This is what \ptivity{} is.

  \ptivity{} does not hold in general.

  It holds in the simple argument because \qzS{}.

  Make this explicit with a variant argument.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  At issue is whether some qualifier such that `\emph{\ptivity{0}}' fails to hold:%
  \footnote{
    The term `\emph{\ptivity{0}}' is designed to highlight the parallel between \emph{\ptivity{0}} and \factivity{}.

    \factivity{2}, \(\mathbb{A}\) \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) only if \(\phi\).

    For example, know \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) only if \(\phi\) or realise \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) only if \(\phi\).

    Fact is necessary in order to have attitude.
    From attitude, get fact.

\subsection{\ptivity{2}}
\label{cha:zSpA:sec:ptivity}

\subsubsection{The principle}

\begin{note}
  \ptivity{2}, agent, proposition, value, qualifier.
  Given qualifier, also holds from agent's perspective.

  \begin{principle}[\ptivity{2}]
    \label{def:perspectivity}
    Given an agent \vAgent{}, proposition \(\phi\), value \(v\), and qualifier \ptivityQV{}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item[]
      \ptivityQV{} satisfies \ptivity{} \emph{only if}:
    \item[]
      \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
      \item[\emph{If}]
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
        \item
          \(\phi\) is \ptivityQV{}'d to have value \(v\) from \vAgent{}' perspective.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item[\emph{then}]
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume]
        \item
          \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \vAgent{}' perspective.
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{principle}

  Note, whether or not \ptivity{} holds with respect to some qualifier \ptivityQV{} is always with respect to some agent, proposition, and value.
  Hence, \ptivity{} allows for the possibility of \ptivity{} to hold or fail depending on the relevant agent, proposition, and value.

  For example, it is possible for \ptivity{} to hold with respect to \ptivityQV{} for some agent \vAgent{}, value \(v\), and proposition \(\phi\) but failing with respect to \vAgent{}, \(v\), and some other proposition \(\phi'\).

  In this respect, \ptivity{} differs from general principles such as \factivity{}, which quantify over agents, propositions, and values.

  The motivation is dialectical.
  Our broad interest is with the arguments for~\autoref{prop:PWEs}.
  Here, we have a fixed agent, proposition, and value.
  And, at issue is whether there may be \emph{some} qualifier such that (positive) answers to~\autoref{prop:PWEs} may be qualified by a qualifier for which \ptivity{} fails.

  So, rather than considering when a qualifier holds for arbitrary agents, propositions, and values, we may restrict our attention to a specific choice of agent, proposition, and value.

  Still, it is straightforward to define \ptivity{} with respect to a qualifier.%
  \footnote{
    \ptivity{2} holds with respect to the qualifier \ptivityQV{} just in case:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[]
      For any agent \vAgent{}, proposition \(\phi\), and value \(v\), \ptivity{} holds with respect to \ptivityQV{}.
    \end{itemize}
  }
\end{note}


\subsubsection{Examples}
\label{cha:zSpA:sec:examples-of-ptivity-y-n}

\begin{note}
  Two positive instances and two negative instances.

  Two negative instances are straightforward.
  \scen{0} such that distinction is important.

  Positive examples are a little different.
  First example, argue that \ptivity{} holds for knowledge as qualifier.
  Second, sketch an argument that \ptivity{} holds for belief as a qualifier.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Positive}

\subparagraph{Knowledge}

\begin{note}[Knowledge]
  Though we have defined \ptivity{} with respect to an agent, proposition and value, there is a straightforward argument that \ptivity{} holds for knowledge when used as a qualifier, regardless of the agent, proposition, or value.

  The argument rests on the \factivity{} of knowledge:

  \begin{principle}[Factivity of knowledge]
    \label{principle:factivity}
    \vAgent{} knows \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{only if} \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \end{principle}

  Specifically, we argue \factivity{} entails:

  \begin{principle}[Factivity of knowledge, relative to perspective]
    \label{principle:factivity-perspective}
    \vAgent{} knows \(\phi\) has value \(v\), from \vAgent{} perspective \emph{only if} \(\phi\) has value \(v\), from \vAgent{}' perspective.
  \end{principle}
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Argument]
  The argument for~\autoref{principle:factivity-perspective} is simple.

  Suppose an agent knows \(\phi\) has value \(v\), from the agent's perspective.
  Then, from the agent's perspective the agent knows \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only if \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Therefore, \(\phi\) must have value \(v\) from the agent's perspective.
  For, else the agent does not know that \(\phi\) has value \(v\), from the agent's perspective.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Elaboration]
  What is being claimed is perhaps clearer with the following principle which directly follows from \factivity{}:%
  \footnote{
    Suppose \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{only if} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), and further suppose \vAgent{} knows \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
    Then, by \factivity{}, \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
    Hence, by the initial assumption, \(\psi\) must have value \(v'\).
  }

  \begin{principle}[Two-step factivity]
    \mbox{ }
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \label{principle:tsf}
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item[\emph{If}]
      \begin{itemize}
      \item[]
        \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{only if} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\),
      \end{itemize}
    \item[\emph{then}]
      \begin{itemize}
      \item[]
        [\vAgent{} knows \(\phi\) has value \(v\)] \emph{only if} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{principle}

  Suppose an agent knows \(\phi\) has value \(v\), from the agent's perspective.

  Now, if \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{only if} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), from the agent's perspective, then \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from the agent's perspective.
  For, applying the same reasoning as above, \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from the agent's perspective, and \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) follows directly from both the conditional and the antecedndent of a conditional holding from the agent's perspective.%
  \footnote{
    Give or take the agent recognising both the condition and the antecedent hold from their perspective and obtain the consequent.
  }

  However, if it is not the case that \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{only if} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), from the agent's perspective, then \(\psi\) need not have value \(v'\) from the agent's perspective.

  For, from the agent's perspective, there is no link between \(\phi\) having value \(v\) and \(\psi\) having value \(v'\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Caution]
  Note, we have not argued that if an agent knows that \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from the agent's perspective, then \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \emph{This} is a far stronger principle.
  \factivity{2}, as stated above, talks about whether an agent knows \(\phi\) has value \(v\) independently of any (particular) agent's perspective.
  Our observation is merely that when internalised to an perspective, \ptivity{} holds for `knows' as a qualifier.
\end{note}

\subparagraph{Belief}

\begin{note}
  We now turn to belief.

  Idea here is that understanding under which \ptivity{} holds with respect to belief.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Looking back]
  Considered belief and agent's perspective in~\autoref{cha:introduction:sec:agents-perspective}.

  So, if you think belief and agent's perspective coincide, then question is whether belief obeys the following:
  \begin{quote}
    Agent believes that they believe \(\phi\) has value \(v\), then the agent believes that \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \end{quote}
  Equivalent to:
  \begin{quote}
    Agent believes \(\phi\) has value \(v\), from their perspective, then \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from their perspective.
  \end{quote}

  This is how I understand the arguments of \citeauthor{Dancy:2000aa} and \citeauthor{Collins:1997wn}.

  Here, take the agent's perspective as basic, and develop motivation based on \citeauthor{Moore:1993wk}an sentences.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Bad for to conflicting things to hold from agent's perspective.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Consider the following \citeauthor{Moore:1993wk}an sentence:%
  \footnote{
    The original sentence \citeauthor{Moore:1993wk} considers is:

    \begin{quote}
      Though I don't believe it's raining, yet as a matter of fact it really is raining.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[207]{Moore:1993wk})}
    \end{quote}
    There are two difficulties with appealing to \citeauthor{Moore:1993wk}'s sentence.

    First, we are interested in belief, rather than the absence of belief.
    Second, the relevant qualifier is plausibly `I don't believe' and the simplistic way in which \ptivity{} is stated does not allow for \(\phi\) not having value \(v\) from the agents perspective to follow from a \emph{intuitively} negative qualifier applied to \(\phi\) having value \(v\), from the agent's perspective.

    There is also some complexity.
    For, `as a matter of fact it really' is, likewise, a qualifier, and though I think it is intuitive that \ptivity{} holds, it is more straightforward to ignore this.
  }

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{M}., ref=(\emph{M})]
  \item
    \label{ptivity:holds:moore-sent}
    I believe it is not raining, though it is raining.
  \end{enumerate}

  Intuitively, problematic.
  For \citeauthor{Moore:1993wk} absurd to assert.%
  \footnote{
    Though, focus of paradox is that it should be absurd to say them.
    (\citeyear[Cf.][208]{Moore:1993wk})
  }

  Likewise, absurd to hold from agent's perspective.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{M\('\)}., ref=(\emph{M\('\)})]
  \item
    \label{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers}
    I believe it is not raining, though it is raining, from my perspective.
  \end{enumerate}


  As~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent} is a conjunction, let us consider the left and right conjuncts individually:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{l}}., ref=(\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{l}})]
  \item
    \label{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:l}
    I believe it is not raining, from my perspective.
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{r}}., ref=(\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{r}})]
  \item
    \label{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r}
    It is raining, from my perspective.
  \end{enumerate}

  Observe, there is no immediate conflict between~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:l} and~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r}.
  {
    \color{red}
    Well, formal.
    Substitute `desire' for `belief', etc.
  }
  Still, if \ptivity{} holds with respect to belief, then~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:l} entails the following:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{l\('\)}}., ref=(\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{l\('\)}})]
  \item
    \label{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:lp}
    It is not raining, from my perspective.
  \end{enumerate}

  Now, \ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:lp} and \ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r} seem to be in clear conflict.
  Indeed, a sufficient (and, I think, plausible) principle we may appeal to here is the principle that it is not possible for \(\phi\) and some proposition \(\phi'\) which conflicts with \(\phi\) to both be true from an agent's perspective.

  Hence, \ptivity{} holding with respect to belief offers an account of why~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers} is absurd.

  In short, because:
  \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item
    \ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers} entails~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r} and~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:lp},
  \item
    \ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r} and~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:lp} are incompatible, and therefore
  \item
    there is no plausible interpretation of \ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers}.
  \end{enumerate*}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The structure of the argument focuses on eliminating a qualifier.
  This is a slightly more subtle point, but is important to keep in mind.
  Of course, eliminating `belief' as a qualifier from~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:l} is expected, given our interest in \ptivity{}.
  But, observe arguing in the converse direction is far from straightforward.
  One may hold that belief as a qualifier should be \emph{introduced} to~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r}.
  However, while the revised~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r} would be in conflict with~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:l}, one would also need to argue that~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:l} should not also be qualified.%
  \footnote{
    Explicitly:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{r+}}., ref=(\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{r+}})]
    \item
      \label{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:rq}
      I believe it is raining, from my perspective.
    \end{enumerate}
    Is in conflict with~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:l}, but if belief is introduced in this way, one needs to resists obtaining:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{l+}}., ref=(\emph{M\('\)\textsubscript{l+}})]
    \item
      \label{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:lq}
      I believe I believe it is not raining, from my perspective.
    \end{enumerate}
    For, any absurdity from conjoining~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:rq} and~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:lq} seems equivalent to the absurdity of conjoining~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r} and~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:l}.

    Indeed, \citeauthor{Moore:1993wk} does this with assertion.
    \begin{quote}
      [T]here is a difference between what I \emph{imply} by uttering assertively the words `it's raining' and what you \emph{imply} by uttering the same words at the same time in the same place.
      Namely I \emph{imply} that I believe it's raining and \emph{not} that you do; you imply that you do, and not that I do.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[209--210]{Moore:1993wk})}
    \end{quote}
    So, by asserting `it's raining', I imply I believe it's raining.
    And, this is in conflict with not believing that it's raining.
    However, it is not immediate that the assertion is in conflict with asserting `I don't believe it's raining', as by the same idea the assertion may only imply that I believe that I don't believe it's raining.
  }
  By contrast, \ptivity{} eliminates belief as a qualifier from~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:l}, and as~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r} is \emph{un}qualified, \ptivity{} does not apply to~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers:r}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  There are a few things to note about this argument.

  First, the argument inconclusive.

  We have provided an explanation for the absurdity of~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers}, but~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers} is a single instance of belief, and we have provided no motivation for thinking what holds of~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers} generalises to other instances of belief.%
  \footnote{
    Indeed, it is not clear to me that \ptivity{} holds with respect to belief in general.
    For example, consider again Goodman's example from~\autoref{fn:belief-is-difficult} on page~\pageref{fn:belief-is-difficult}.
  }

  Second, the argument is not valid.
  For, we have not argued that the only way to obtain the absurdity of~\ref{ptivity:holds:moore-sent:pers} is via \ptivity{} holding with respect to belief.

  Still, in response to both of these points, I think the argument as is highlights why one may expect \ptivity{} to hold with respect to belief, and this, I think, is sufficient for present purposes.
  \end{note}

\paragraph[Failures of \ptivity{}]{Two scenarios in which \ptivity{} fails to hold}

\begin{note}
  Two instances.

  First instance builds on the idea of taking an non-committal such as `seems',
  Second, on an antagonistic qualifier such as `misrepresented'.

  In first case, non-committal.
  In second case, some incompatible proposition holds from agent's perspective.

  However, neither instance depends on the term for the qualifier chosen, or a complete description of the qualifier.
  Instead, two \scen{1} where capture what's going on via a failure of \ptivity{} to hold for whichever qualifier.
\end{note}

\subparagraph{The first \scen{0}}

\begin{note}
  The first scenario is interactive!

  \begin{scenario}[\citeauthor{Zollner:1860vx}]
    You looking at the variation of the \citeauthor{Zollner:1860vx} illusion given in \autoref{fig:zollner-illusion}.
    \begin{figure}[!h]
      \centering
      \def\svgwidth{\columnwidth}
      \input{ZIOh.pdf_tex}
      \caption{A variation of the \citeauthor{Zollner:1860vx} illusion --- crop of ~\textcite{Fibonacci:2007vj}}
      \label{fig:zollner-illusion}
    \end{figure}
  \end{scenario}

  \autoref{fig:zollner-illusion} contains eight long black lines which are crossed with short black lines.
  Alternating, between the long lines from left to right. the short lines are horizontal and then almost vertical.

  To me, at least, the long black lines do not appear parallel to one another.
  And, I suspect the same it true for you.

  Further, as~\autoref{fig:zollner-illusion} is titled `a variation of the \citeauthor{Zollner:1860vx} illusion' I guess you might think the long black lines really are parallel to one another.
  Though, to keep this interactive, there is a slight twist.
  In the \citeauthor{Zollner:1860vx} illusion the long black lines are, indeed, parallel to one another.
  However, as~\autoref{fig:zollner-illusion} is titled a variation, the long black lines may not be parallel to one another.

  So, I would guess the following is true of you:

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    It \emph{seems} long black lines are not parallel, from your perspective.
  \item
    The long black lines are neither parallel nor not parallel, from your perspective.
  \end{itemize}

  Here, `seems' is being used as a qualifier for which \ptivity{} does not hold.
  Indeed, if \ptivity{} were to hold for `seems' then it would follow that the long black lines are not parallel, from your perspective.
  But, given what has been typed above I am guessing you are ambivalent about whether the long black lines are parallel to one another.

  Likewise, the following is true of me:

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    It \emph{seems} long black lines are not parallel, from my perspective.
  \item
    The long black lines are parallel, from my perspective.%
    \footnote{
      Unfortunately, the variation is limited to a simple crop of~\textcite{Fibonacci:2007vj}'s image.
    }
  \end{itemize}

  The long black lines are parallel, from my perspective, as I've analysed the image using tools.
  However, the illusion continues to hold, and it remains the case that it \emph{seems} the long black lines are not parallel, from my perspective.

  Again, the failure of \ptivity{} for the qualifier `seems' is important for distinguishing between how the long black lines are (parallel to one another) and how they appear to me (not parallel to one another).
\end{note}

\subparagraph{The second \scen{0}}

\begin{note}
  The second \scen{0} is a variation on ideas common to external-world scepticism.%
  \footnote{
    It is unclear to me whether the following \scen{0} is compatible with \hyperlink{cite.Descartes:1996vp}{Cartesian} scepticism.

    For, consider \citeauthor{Lichtenberg:1991tf}'s remark:

    \begin{quote}

      Zu sagen \emph{cogito}, ist schon zu viel, so bald man es durch \emph{Ich denke} \"{U}bersetzt.
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[412]{Lichtenberg:1991tf}/K76)}
    \end{quote}

    As translated by \citeauthor{Zoller:1992ud}'s:

    \begin{quote}
      One should say, \emph{it thinks}, just as one says, \emph{it lightens}.
      It is already saying too much to say \emph{cogito}, as soon as one translates it as \emph{I think}.
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[418]{Zoller:1992ud})}
    \end{quote}

    In other words, it is unclear whether \hyperlink{cite.Descartes:1996vp}{Cartesian} scepticism is compatible with a subject to attribute the qualified perspective to.
    See also \textcite{Perry:1986aa}.

  \nocite{Harman:1973ww}

  In the \scen{0} the agent on interest, Cypher, is taking to Agent Smith.
  The Matrix is a simulation of the world as it was in 1999, and both Cypher and Agent Smith are eating at a restaurant `inside' the Matrix.
  However, Cypher has experienced the (real) world `outside' of the matrix.

    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{scenario}

  With this \scen{}, our interest is with what hold with respect the following proposition when assigned value true, from Cypher's perspective:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    There is a steak.
  \end{itemize}

  From the first statement made by Cypher, the steak does not exist, so the proposition is not true from Cypher's perspective.
  However, from the second statement, it seems the proposition is true.
  For, Cypher \emph{knows} what will happen when Cypher puts it in his mouth.
  And, surely, Cypher cannot put a non-existing thing in his mouth.

  So, naively, the two statements are in conflict with one another.
  The difficulty is resolved with a simple qualifier for which \ptivity{} fails to hold.
  For example, consider `misrepresents':

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    It is not the case there is a steak, from Cypher's perspective.
  \item
    Cypher misrepresents that there is a steak, from Cypher's perspective.
  \end{itemize}
  Some term other than `misrepresents' may work equally well.
  Though, whichever term is chosen, the point remains the same:
  Cypher is aware that they are in the Matrix, and therefore from Cypher's perspective, Cypher's thoughts regarding objects `in' the Matrix are qualified, from Cypher's perspective.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Summary}

\begin{note}
  We have provided two examples where \ptivity{} arguably holds for a qualifier, and two examples involving \scen{1} where a qualifier for which \ptivity{} fails is important for capturing the details of the respective \scen{0}.

  Hence, as \ptivity{} may hold or fail to hold, there is room to question whether an agent's perspective may be qualified and whether \ptivity{} holds for the agent's perspective when qualified.

  We link \ptivity{} to~\autoref{prop:PWEs} in~\autoref{cha:zSpA:sec:ptivity-prop}, below.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Other examples]
  Still, before doing so, and with instances where \ptivity{} holds and fails in hand, the general worry being raised may be highlighted by considering a final case in which it is not clear whether the agent's perspective is qualified, and if \ptivity{} holds given qualification.%
  \footnote{
    We present here a toy \scen{0}.
    For a less toy scenario, consider `\emph{evidence of}' as a qualifier in the phrase `evidence of evidence is evidence'.
    In other words, is it the case that \(\mathbb{E}\) is \emph{evidence of} evidence for \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) (from an agent's perspective) entails \(\mathbb{E}\) is evidence for \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) (from an agent's perspective).
    See, e.g.\ \textcite{Tal:2017uw} for discussion of the complexity involved in answering this.
  }

  \begin{scenario}[Soup]
    \label{scen:soup}
    An agent is eating some soup at a restaurant.
    After eating some of the soup, the agent remarks:
    \begin{quote}
      `The chef added too much salt to this soup.'
    \end{quote}
  \end{scenario}

  Initially, we may not that taste is subjective.
  Therefore the following holds of~\autoref{scen:soup}:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*, ref=(\arabic*)]
  \item
    \label{chef:1}
    The chef added too much salt to this soup, from agent's perspective.
  \end{enumerate}

  However, if taste is subjective, then whether or not the chef added too much salt to the soup should be qualified by something like `for the agent's tastes'.
  Hence, strictly, \ref{chef:1} is \emph{not} the case, but \ref{chef:2} is the case:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*, ref=(\arabic*), resume]
  \item
    \label{chef:2}
    For the agent's tastes, the chef added too much salt to this soup, from agent's perspective.
  \end{enumerate}

  Where, `for the agent's tastes' is a qualifier for which \ptivity{} does not hold, as we have no clear indication on whether or not the chef added too much salt apart from the agent's perspective.

  Still, to complicate matters further, the agent may understand the chef was not aware of the agent's tastes when creating the soup.
  And, perhaps is considering the right amount of salt for the average customer.
  So, \ref{chef:3}, rather than \ref{chef:2}, captures the content of the agent's remark:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*, ref=(\arabic*), resume]
  \item
    \label{chef:3}
    For the average customer, the chef added too much salt to this soup, from agent's perspective.
  \end{enumerate}

  Now, \ref{chef:3} begins with the phrase `for the average customer'.
  Interpreted as a qualifier, \ptivity{} seems to fail---the average customer's tastes are subjective.
  However, the phrase need not function as a qualifier, and it is the case that (from the agent's perspective) the chef added too much salt to this soup for the average customer.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, some care, is need to provide a clear statement of which propositions have which values from the agent's perspective, which proposition-value pairs are qualified, and a statement of whether or not \ptivity{} holds for any qualification.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Relation between \ptivity{} and~\autoref{prop:PWEs}}
\label{cha:zSpA:sec:ptivity-prop}

\begin{note}
  We have stated \ptivity{} and seen through a handful of examples how \ptivity{} hold or fail to hold.

  We now highlight the relation between \ptivity{} and~\autoref{prop:PWEs}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\ptivity{} \& \qzS{}]
  The agent is fixed by the relevant instance of \qzS{}, the value is `True', and the proposition of interest is:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item[]
    There is a potential event in which agent concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
  \end{itemize}

  Where the relevant \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Phi\) are likewise specified by the instance of \qzS{}.

  In order for~\autoref{prop:PWEs}, it must be the case that the relevant instance of \qzS{} is, from the relevant agent's perspective, answered by:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=A., ref=A]
  \item
    \label{ptivity:qzS:ans:good}
    \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{}.
  \end{enumerate}

  However, introduce a qualifier, so that the relevant instance of \qzS{} is, from the relevant agent's perspective, answered by:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=A\('\)., ref=A\('\)]
  \item
    \label{ptivity:qzS:ans:bad}
    It is \ptivityQV{}'d to be true that \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Phi}\) is a \fc{}.
  \end{enumerate}

  Where, \ptivity{} fails for \ptivityQV{}, and therefore~\ref{ptivity:qzS:ans:good} need not hold, from the agent's perspective.

  Worry, slightly indirect.
  \ptivity{} fails, possibility.
  However, even if \ptivity{} holds, issue of question.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Summary}

\begin{note}
  \ptivity{}.
  Whether qualify how things are from the agent's perspective.

  Distinction, given distinction possibility to qualify perspective in answers to \qzS{}.

  This is the key thought.
  However, a little more complex.
\end{note}


\subsection{\ptivityQ{2}}
\label{cha:zSpA:sec:ptivityq}

\begin{note}
  In the previous section we introduced \ptivity{}, provided a handful of examples where \ptivity{} holds and fails to hold, and observed how \ptivity{} is indirectly related to the arguments for~\autoref{prop:PWEs}.

  In the present section to present a variation of \ptivity{} that is directly related to the arguments for~\autoref{prop:PWEs}.
  This variant of \ptivity{} ties whether or not \ptivity{} holds to a question.
  We term the variant `\ptivityQ{}'.

  We begin by stating \ptivityQ{}, and how \ptivityQ{} directly relates to the arguments for~\autoref{prop:PWEs}.
  Following, we observe that \ptivity{} holding does not entail \ptivityQ{} holds.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In this section we present a refined version of \ptivity{} with involves reference to a question.

  Failure instances adapt, but success instances do not.
  Hence, observing \ptivity{} holds for any qualifier suitable for a positive answer to \qzS{} isn't quite sufficient.%
  \footnote{
    Dialectic choice.
    Break down \autoref{prop:PWEs} and \autoref{corr:prop:PWEs} into distinct propositions.

    \autoref{prop:PWEs} concerns answers to \qzS{}.

    Strictly, relation to question isn't important.
    Matters is \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
    \autoref{corr:prop:PWEs}.
  }
\end{note}

\subsubsection{The principle}

\begin{note}[The principle]
  \ptivityQ{2} is a straightforward variation of \ptivity{}, in which the move from a proposition-value pair holding under some qualifier (from an agent's perspective) to the proposition-value pair holding from the agent's perspective is tied to a fixed question.
  The principle is as follows:

  \begin{principle}[\ptivityQ{2}]
    \label{def:perspectivityQ}
    For an agent \vAgent{}, proposition \(\phi\), value \(v\), and question \emph{Q}:

    A qualifier \ptivityQV{} satisfies \ptivityQ{} \emph{only if}:

    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item[\emph{If}]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \(\phi\) is \ptivityQV{}'d to have value \(v\) answers \emph{Q}, from \vAgent{}' perspective .
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{then}]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume]
      \item
        \(\phi\) has value \(v\) answers \emph{Q}, from \vAgent{}' perspective.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{principle}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Now, applies to \autoref{prop:PWEs}.

  Quantifies over agent's and instance of \qzS{}.

  Hence, fix agent, relevant proposition, value, and question:

  Agent.

  Question, \qzS{}.
\end{note}

\paragraph{No entailment}

\begin{note}[Proposition]
  So, \ptivityQ{}.
  Now observe the following proposition:

  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:ptivity-ne-ptivityQ}
    Given an agent \vAgent{}, proposition \(\phi\), value \(v\), question \emph{Q}, and qualifier \ptivityQV{}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \ptivity{2} holding with respect to \vAgent{}, \(\phi\), \(v\), and \ptivityQV{}.
    \end{itemize}

    Does \emph{not} entail:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \ptivityQ{2} holds with respect to \vAgent{}, \(\phi\), \(v\), \ptivityQV{}, and \emph{Q}.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  With respect to the arguments for \autoref{prop:PWEs}, it is insufficient to observe that \ptivity{} holds for any qualifier.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Argument for proposition]
  The argument for \autoref{prop:ptivity-ne-ptivityQ} builds on a \scen{0} from \citeauthor{Hyman:1999tm} (\citeyear{Hyman:1999tm}):

  \begin{quote}
    [S]uppose Ruth reasons as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=, noitemsep]
    \item
      I believe that property is theft
    \item
      People who believe that property is theft should join the Workers’ Party
    \item
      So I should join.
    \end{enumerate}

    And so she joins.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[444]{Hyman:1999tm})}
  \end{quote}

  \citeauthor{Hyman:1999tm} observes:

  \begin{quote}
    The fact that she believes that property is theft is among her reasons, but the fact, or the supposed fact, that property is theft is not.\newline
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[444]{Hyman:1999tm})}
  \end{quote}

  Here, question is `Should I join the Workers’ Party?'

  If you think \ptivity{} holds for belief, then \scen{} in which \ptivity{} holds but \ptivityQ{} fails to hold.%
  \footnote{
    Counterexample to the arguments of \citeauthor{Collins:1997wn}.

    However, delicate.

    \begin{quote}
      We could introduce psychological matters if we mean that they are the things that make his situation and his course of action intelligible to an agent.
      But if objective circumstances are what make his own action intelligible to the agent then we do not depart from the agent's perspective in putting forward objective circumstances in the context of reason-giving.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[120]{Collins:1997wn})}
    \end{quote}

    Carefully stated, \citeauthor{Collins:1997wn} goes for \ptivity{} with respect to belief, but not for  \ptivityQ{}.

    From the preface:
    \begin{quote}
      Wherever an agent correctly adduces a belief that an objective circumstance obtains in explaining his action, a de-psychologizing restatement that merely makes the objective claim must be ascribable to the agent.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[120]{Collins:1997wn})}
    \end{quote}

    Here, objective circumstances are believing (or knowing).
    So, \citeauthor{Collins:1997wn}, not possible to weaken to belief that belief, or belief that knows.
  }

  For, qualified from agent's perspective, as qualified is sufficient to answer.
  And, as sufficient, unqualified does not answer.

  If you don't think \ptivity{} holds for belief, and specifically fails in this instance, the consider substituting `belief' from `knows' through the \scen{0}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  So, given proposition concerns \qzS{}, and failure of entailment from~\autoref{prop:ptivity-ne-ptivityQ}, this is what we're interested in.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Belief.

  Arguments by \citeauthor{Collins:1997wn} and \citeauthor{Dancy:2000aa}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Even if \ptivity{} holds, not clear that holds with respect to a question.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  More generally, fails for factive attitudes.
  Substitution into \citeauthor{Hyman:1999tm}'s scenario.

  Basically, scenario is such that question asks about qualifier.

  Looking ahead, key point.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Collins:1997wn}, may hold from agent's perspective, and \citeauthor{Hyman:1999tm}, agent's perspective may be irrelevant to why.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Similar, though distinct.
  ~\cite{Donnellan:1966wt}.

  Attributive and referential.

  With attributive, nothing in mind.
  Similar, here the agent gives up what the time actually is.
  However, for~\citeauthor{Donnellan:1966wt}, the way things are still matter.

  Well, this is not clear.

  So, said something true, even though not referring to anything.
  Of course, from agent's perspective.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Interest with \ptivity{} is with respect to \autoref{prop:PWEs}.
  So\dots
\end{note}

\subsection{Revisiting the arguments}
\label{cha:zSpA:sec:revisiting-arguments}

\begin{note}
  Issue is whether what answers \qzS{} is potential event from agent's perspective, or  weaker, independent of whether there is a potential event.

  So, whether it is possible for the agent to substitute in some qualifier that does not lead to potential event from agent's perspective.

  If qualifiers exist, then problem.
  For, conclusion holds with these qualifiers.

  From the agent's perspective, and aware of this.
  So, don't get \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \fc{}.
  Rather than \ref{prop:PWEs:c} perspective:
  {
    \color{red}
    \(\qzSaV{}\) involves, in part, \vAgent{}' perspective that \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \fc{}.
  }

  Do \citeauthor{Hyman:1999tm}'s reasoning.
  \begin{quote}
    \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is \ptivityQV{}'d to be a \fc{}.

    If \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is \ptivityQV{}'d to be a \fc{}, then answer \qzS{}.

    So, done.
  \end{quote}
  Observation is this conditional.
  Antecedent true and conclusion false.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The point is, \qzS{} is asked from the agent's perspective.
  And, the content of \qzS{} is not qualified.

  The simple argument goes through because we adopt the agent's perspective in both cases.
\end{note}

\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

\begin{note}
  Question about \qzS{}.
  Address in final section, though the summary is easy to state.
  This objection because~\autoref{prop:PWEs}.
  Consequence of \qzS{}.
  Weakening the question might be possible, but nothing more to say.

  In other words,~\autoref{cha:zS} already addresses this.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Limitation]
  \color{blue}
  Point is \fc{} in which concludes.
  However, it does not follow that we get the reason.
  We're still from the agent's perspective.

  Parallel with more standard case of reason explanation.

\newpage

\section{The question?}
\label{cha:zSpA:sec:ptivity-question}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  Okay, the issue here is pychologism, etc.
  It seems there's some motivation for messing with what is the case from the agent's perspective based on a stance here.

  For, act on reasons.
  It's possible that agent thinks is the case is false.
  So, it's got to be the case that for the agent, we don't simply have a state of affairs.
  Instead, something like belief, a psychological state.

  So, if there's a link between answers to \qzS{} and `Why?'%
  \footnote{
    Note, here, basic understanding of the question `Why?'.
  }
  , then should revise the question.
  It shouldn't be about what is the case from the agent's perspective, but instead about something that could be a reason.

  But, this doesn't work.
  Because, \qWhyV{} is stated from the agent's perspective.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Observe, after clarify \ptivity{} and \ptivityQ{}, arguments relied on form of question.

  However, distinction applied to the question.

  Possible to weaken \qzS{}.

  Introduce some qualifier.

  Motivated by moral realism.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  {
    \color{red}
    What I want to get here is that there's no motivation for weakening the question.
    If go for factivity, then it will apply to all instances of reasoning/concluding.

    \qWhyV{} is stated from agent's perspective.

    \emph{After take into account agent's perspective, there's no motivation to further restrict.}
  }
  \color{blue}
  So, the objection goes:
  Only get reasons by appealing to truths.
  In these cases, the agent recognises that it's only their perspective.
  So, in these cases, the agent is appealing to what holds from their perspective.

  Hence, there's a problem with why.

  However, I want to explain why the agent concludes.
  Right.
  Now, worries about facts.
  However, if you're worried about this, then it's going to be a worry for all instances of concluding.
  
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \phantlabel{return-to-dancy}
  \citeauthor{Dancy:2000aa}, \hyperref[dancy-to-return]{noted above}.

  Distinction between psychologism and non-psychologism.

  \begin{quote}
    [P]sychologism holds that reasons are mental states such as “an agent’s believing (or wanting, or knowing) something”, and it is easy to move from the claim that someone’s reason is \emph{his believing something} (a mental state) to the claim that his reason is \emph{that he believes} something (a psychological fact).%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor[\S3]{Alvarez:2017vr})}
  \end{quote}

  Non-psychologism denies this, all sorts of things.

  Now, everything so far is independent of this distinction.
  Qualified, from the agent's perspective, so psychologism.
  Here, though, reason is understood independent of the agent's perspective.

  Difficulty is if reason holds in both cases.
  But, stayed away from any claims about reasons.

  So, gap.

  \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa} terms this `Dancy's gap'.

  However, moral realism.
  Require Dancy's gap to be closed.

  \begin{quote}
    [I]n cases where Angus punches his boss, believing mistakenly that he has been fired, it seems quite wrong to say he so acts because he has been fired.
    In such a case we surely must retreat to a psychologised explanation if we are to have a credible motivating reason explanation at all.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[\S6]{Lenman:2011wy})}%
    \footnote{
      See also~\textcite[\S2]{Alvarez:2017vr}.
    }
  \end{quote}

  As I understand this, \citeauthor{Dancy:2000aa} is here distinguishing between what is the case from the agent's perspective.
  So, in this case, do not explain via firing.
  For, still mediated by the agent's perspective.

  However, pressure is whether content of agent's perspective explains.

  Issue is moral realism and causation.

  Following the book, mistaken.
  Then, nothing.
  Must be the agent's perspective, rather than content of the agent's perspective.

  Or, something that is not the case.

  Not the distinction interested in.

  Different perspective.

  Agent's perspective, so this is a different explanation from third person perspective.
  From third person, include agent's perspective.

  So, if mind the gap, instances of \qzS{}, and argument goes through, then it seems there's a problem.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Example:

  \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa}
  \begin{quote}
    It seems appropriate that in the explanation of her action the agent’s activities should, so to speak, ‘stand in’ for those (purported) facts that she takes to be reason-giving.
    Her taking them to be reasons explains her action.
    Thus, she is accountable for her actions---she, not the facts that call for action, brings her action to be.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[425]{Hieronymi:2011aa})}
  \end{quote}

  Taking, qualification.
  But, repeat the argument from before.%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{DOro:2013vh} also \citeauthor{Alvarez:2010to}, disjunctivism.
    \begin{quote}
      [O]ur actions are to be explained by \emph{what} we believe in veridical cases and by facts about our believing what we believe when our beliefs are false.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[30]{DOro:2013vh})}
    \end{quote}
    Similar issue, as proposition applies generally.
    No distinction, and so mistakes are still a problem.

    In this case, things are even more difficult.
    And, to be honest, I don't care.
  }

  So, must reduce to question.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  However, this won't really affect anything going forward.
  For, the point is that we get a relation of support.
  That's the goal.
  Now, if we press these worries from moral realism, then the same is going to hold with relations of support.
  For, need a genuine relation of support.
  But, always possible for the agent to be mistaken about this.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Considered \ptivity{}.

  Given \qzS{}, \ptivity{} holds with respect to answers.

  However, is this the right understanding of \qzS{}?
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Break \qzS{} away from \qWhy{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Second option, weaken the question.
  So, what we're interested in is whether the agent thinks they're going to conclude.

  So, now, we're going the weaker question.
  Now, because this is weaker, it doesn't matter, from the agent's perspective `properly' understood, what would happen.

  Weaker question, then need this distinction.
  Hence, surely ask what's going to happen.
  Hence, best thing we get here is failure for the present question to have any relation to \qWhy{}.

  This, argued for in \autoref{cha:zS}.
  Sufficient motivation.

  This is difficult.
  The first idea is to consider negative cases.
  So, for example, lost keys.
  Here, things look straightforward.
  It really is a problem for the agent that they \emph{might} conclude otherwise.

  So, this suggests to me that in cases where the same question seems to hold, what matters to the agent is that the \emph{would not} conclude otherwise.

  However, I think this falls short of a suitable response.

  For, this is just switching perspective.
  If two different perspectives on the same thing, and these conflict, this doesn't favour either perspective.

  Look, in contrast, here this really is not possibility of a stronger answer.
  The thing about making the distinction with respect to \qzS{} is that we have something to work with.
  When asking whether \qzS{} makes sense, whether there could be a weaker question, there is nothing else to make sense with.

  Before, the distinction was interesting because it had the potential to show that~\autoref{prop:PWEs} does not hold.
  Here, there's no possibility of anything like this.

  So, no pursuing this any further.
