\begin{note}[Epistemic]
  The entailment is epistemic.
  Meaning, information of antecedent is sufficient to establish consequent.
  It is not the case that the consequent holds because the antecedent holds.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Quick test]
  Potential \(e\) is the reason why \(\psi\).
  \(\psi\) is the reason why there is potential \(e\).

  Some good instances and some bad.

  Bad is the flight example.
  These are, in the appropriate sense, preconditions.
  So, the relation of support is inverted.

  However, from epistemic perspective, things may go the other way.

  Here, interested in \emph{de dicto} reading of EEE (\citeyear[8]{Tal:2017uw})
  \citeauthor{Tal:2017uw} presents counterexample.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence for H, but H is false.
  \end{itemize}
  Hence, evidence of evidence, but not evidence for whatever H is evidence for.
  (\citeyear[10]{Tal:2017uw}).
  Examples do not have this structure.

  \begin{quote}
    For all e and p, if (i) e is evidence that there is evidence for p and (ii) e is not a defeater for the support that the proposition that there is evidence for p provides for p, then e is evidence for p.\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[14]{Tal:2017uw})}
  \end{quote}
  \AR{} seems to satisfy.
  From ability, there are premises which provide support for conclusion.
  Ability is not a defeater.
  So ability provides support for conclusion.


% \begin{note}[Simple way]
%   Entailment holds between

%   \cite{Longino:1979vh} distinguishes three kinds of relations with respect to (evidential) support.
%   \begin{quote}
%     \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*)]
%     \item\label{longino:1} a relation between a sentence describing a state of affairs said to be evidence and a sentence, the hypothesis, for which the state of affairs is said to be evidence; (Sen > Sen)
%     \item\label{longino:2} a relation between a state of affairs said to be evidence and another state of affairs described by a hypothesis for which the former is said to be evidence; (Sof > Sof)
%     \item\label{longino:3} a relation between a state of affairs said to be evidence and a statement or proposition, the hypothesis, for which the former is said to be evidence. (Sof > proposition)\nolinebreak
%     \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[36]{Longino:1979vh})}
%     \end{enumerate}
%   \end{quote}

%   So, entailment requires some language, so representation to representation, loosening \citeauthor{Longino:1979vh} a little.
%   This gives us~\ref{longino:1}.
%   Entailment does not (directly) establish relation of support between interpretation of (representation of) antecedent and interpretation of (representation of) consequent.

%   ~\ref{longino:3} then considers support between interpretation of representation and representation.
%   ~\ref{longino:2} directly to interpretations of representations.

%   So long as entailment is restricted to representations, then considering support between interpretations will be distinct.

%   Possible, but this is not what we are interested in.
%   There are difficult cases (de dicto, etc.), but bracketing these make no distinction.
% \end{note}


\begin{note}[Neta]
More recent in \citeauthor{Neta:2019aa}.
  \begin{quote}
    For an agent A to C for reason R involves A’s \emph{de se}, object-involving representation of a particular explanatory relation between R, on the one hand, and her C’ing, on the other, and that object-involving representation represents that same explanatory relation under the category ex post justifying.\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[204]{Neta:2019aa})}
  \end{quote}
  Distinct from other accounts.

  \emph{De se} so that there no possible mistake about whether it is the agent that is C'ing.
  The explanatory connexion is represented.
  \citeauthor{Neta:2019aa} is non-committal to what is involved with representation.


  Issue is \emph{ex post} justification.
  This is, roughly, doxastic support.

  So, \citeauthor{Neta:2019aa} analysis touches on basis, but doesn't provide sufficient resources to determine whether agent has doxastic support/is \emph{ex post} supported.
  Still, no \emph{ex post}.
  Because \citeauthor{Neta:2019aa} requires correspondence between explanatory relation and C'ing.
  No possible to separate forming attitude to conclusion from reasoning to conclusion, on assumption that reasoning is required for \emph{ex post}.
  Hence, if rearranged, so that basis provides \emph{ex post}, then no possible \emph{ex post} in cases of interest.
  Though, of course, not required by \citeauthor{Neta:2019aa}.
  \end{note}


  At the present, the agent has not witnessed the relation of support.
  However, to evaluate, appeal to the potential event used.
  So long as this does establish support (in line with the information) then the agent claims support.


\begin{note}[Another difficulty]
  Another difficulty with the first pass is tight connexion with particular propositional support.
  Increase in information, etc.
  Seems as though the agent may obtain conclusion of distinct propositional support.

  Chess example, there may be multiple strategies.
  One is sufficient.

  Other examples are more complex.
  For example, proof.
  Study, develop understanding of domain.
  Additional premises available.
  Does this resolve the \future{}?

  Perhaps not, agent no longer has a need to resolve the particular \future{}.

  However, as in the case of multiple strategies, plausible that additional premises fold into the same \future{}.
  So long as there remains a potential witnessing event, it seems any witness should resolve the \future{}.

  Some improvements may be made.
  First, detail a more pressing difficulty.

 \begin{note}[Motivation: examples]
  Handful of examples from literature on failure of transmission.

  Don't need to hold that these are cases of transmission failure.
  Agent may get support.
  However, agent does not get support by denying~\nI{}.

  In part, the distinction above helps understand.
  The agent does not get that it's not a cleverly disguised mule from vision.
  Rather, it's the fact that the agent is seeing, and what follows from this.

  {
    \color{red}
    Here note important point that~\nI{} does not prevent the agent from obtaining support.
  }

  However, our interest in~\nI{}.
  Information.
  Hence, the agent may be in a position to claim support for \(\phi\), and the information need not be something that the agent is in a position to identify by themselves.

  ``If that's a zebra and that's a ?, then you're in a position to distinguish species X from species Y.''

  As above, may be that the agent obtains support, but not via denying~\nI{}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}[Indirect]
  The really important idea is that in the cases of interest, if the agent goes from general ability, then it's \emph{indirect}.
  The agent is not using their general ability.
  Rather, the agent is relying on having the general ability.

  Further, the consequent is a potential counterexample.
  This is what really distinguishes things, I think.

  The idea, then, is that if \(\psi\) is not the case, then the agent has an counterexample to \(\phi\).
  Hence, as the agent doesn't `do' anything to show that \(\psi\) is the case, they can't simply transmit support for \(\phi\) to \(\psi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[`includes']
  General to specific is an `includes' conditional.
  If support for general, then extends to specific.
  Key idea here is that general and specific reduce down to similar things.

  So, the additional component of interest is that the agent should be, in some sense, committed to have support for any specific instance of general ability.
  Something like \(\forall S(G \rightarrow S)\).
  However, there's something puzzling about this.
  Because, the agent has no idea what those applications are.

  \nI{} suggests.
  For, agent would be relying on support for general not being misleading, and a specific may show that it is.
  
  So, it seems this doesn't provide the agent with support.
  So, something about support from some subset extending to other elements of set.

  Gives an intuitive example.
  Picking balls out of a bag.
  Well, it's the case that all the balls are red, otherwise I've picked out a non-representative sample.
  Quite possible that this is the case.
  Agent doesn't get support for next being red.
  Though, agent has support for a probability distribution.

  This really goes back to the idea that the agent has no idea whether the support they have will be shown to be misleading.

  If so, the LP example isn't so clear cut.
  For, if the agent's got enough support that wouldn't be shown to be misleading, the use of conditional goes through.
  Further support added, but what they have remains robust.
  Right, this seems correct.

  Same for balls in a bag.
  It's possible that the next ball revises the probability distribution, if the agent isn't aware of what's going on in the bag.
  No, this doesn't quite work.
  It only really works if the agent makes an assumption about the colours or something of the kind.
  See this would be a bad assumption to make, because the next ball would show the assumption to be misleading.

  Hence, because specific would be an application of general, then failure of specific would show that there's something wrong with general.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\WR{} and \AR{}]
  Role of~\nI{} should be clearest with the difference between \AR{} and \WR{}.

  With \AR{}, the agent appeals to support they have for general ability.
  This support, we assume, is accessible to the agent.
  And, the difficulty is that the agent would find that some support is misleading if they don't have the general ability.
  The issue with~\nI{} is that the agent appeals to support for general ability, not the support for items of application of general ability.

  One way to look at this is in terms of whether the agent has the ability.
  For, with \AR{}, this seems to be how things go.
  Support for general ability, therefore one has the general ability, and so one has the specific ability, and hence one has support for specific ability.
  So, projection of belief.

  Another perspective is that the agent is not \emph{applying} general ability in order for specific ability.
  Which, is roughly what is meant by `indirectness'.
  There should be something here, as this really is the core difference between the two approaches.
  For, with \WR{}, then, the agent traces support through reasoning\dots
  Relying on the support that application provides for conclusion.
  Not, that there's something wrong if the agent doesn't get support for conclusion.
  And this ties in with the useful point.
  If lack, then the support is misleading.
  However, from agent's perspective, they've extended support from premises to conclusion, and have not relied on indirect claim that this can be done.
  Of course, the agent doesn't have access, and hence conflict with~\uRa{}.

  With \WR{} the agent relies on information, needs to be true that they may witness.
  Agent does not require support for this.
  Rather, it is true, and then support builds throughout the process.


  With \WR{}, the agent applies support as they would in reasoning.
  So, the agent is not appealing to support for general ability, but support general ability provides for premises and steps of reasoning.
  The difficult, and conflict with~\uRa{} is that the agent does not have access to what they are claiming support for.
  However, support functions the same way as if the agent were to witness the reasoning.

  Return to the idea of projection of belief.
  With \WR{}, the agent does not project belief.
  For, agent `witnesses' \dots but this is difficult, because agent still relies on information for \(W\) attitude.
  


  A useful point is that the support being misleading if the agent lacks the specific ability does not mean that the agent is obtaining support for specific ability on the basis that the support for the general ability is not misleading.

  This useful point is clearest to see when considering an instance of reasoning.
  
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Requires some care]
  \nI{} requires a little care.
  It is a constraint on whether the agent has the option of obtaining support.
  It does not constrain whether the agent is able to make use of the information in other ways.

  Useful example may be commitment.
  For example, committed to \(\psi\), but no support.

  In particular, support for \(\lnot\psi\) seems difficult.
  The agent doesn't have the option of obtaining support for \(\psi\).
  However, it seems that with the information there is some resistance to support for \(\lnot\psi\).

  This point will be important later.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Inertia and attribution]
  \nI{} raises a problem for applying \AR{} to the specific ability of scenarios described by~\eA{}.

  For, the agent is required to obtain specific ability from general ability.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Agent has support for the general ability to reason with the rules of chess.
  \item However, the agent has not demonstrated the existence of the strategy, and so the agent relies on the information provided by the informer to hold that they have the specific ability to demonstrate the existence of the strategy.
  \item Still, the informer provided by the informer requires the agent to endorse having the general ability to reason with the rules of chess.
  \item In turn, that whatever support the agent has for having the general ability to reason with the rules of chess is not misleading.
  \item For, it may be the case that the agent does not have the ability to demonstrate the existence of the particular strategy.
  \item Therefore, the agent does not obtain support for the ability to demonstrate the existence of the strategy.
  \item Hence, it is not an option for the agent to obtain support for the existence of the strategy on the basis of support for the ability to demonstrate the strategy in line with \AR{}
  \end{enumerate}
