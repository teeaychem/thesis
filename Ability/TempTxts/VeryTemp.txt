Argued that X is a necessary condition for Y, then argue that if Y does not hold, then X does not hold.
  Euclian, triangle then sum of angles is 180.
  If not 180, then not a triangle.

  (Here, triangle is connecting points, so 180 is not trivial.)

  However, if establish something stronger, then may show claimed support was misleading.
  For example, keys are not in the house.
  Then, not in coat hanging next to the door.
  Of course, but recheck and find them there.
  In this case, figure out that one was misled by previous check.


    Variation on key example.
  Keys are not in the house.
  Well, then in the car.
  So, check the car.

    Thing is, what's intended here is that failure for \(\psi\) shows a problem with \(\phi\).
    Hum, so in the spreadsheet case, \(\phi\) is that the colleague is reliable.
    And, then, it's not clear that one mistake establishes that the colleague is not reliable.
    So, the point here is that depending on the instances of \(\phi\) and \(\psi\), it may not be the case that a single failure is sufficient to establish an issue with \(\phi\).
    It would show a problem with the particular instance, but \(\phi\) itself, and the reasoning that one does with \(\phi\), tolerates some bad instances.

    To help, in this case, there's an extra step to get from \(\phi\) to \(\psi\), and \nI{} doesn't say anything about this step.
    So, there would need to be a problem with the colleague being truthful, but it's really strange to think that one is required to check every instance.
    Hum, this is a good way to look at things.
    However, it still needs to be the case that it's limited to the colleague being reliable, because any failure is sufficient to show that the agent colleague never gets things wrong.
    However, if this is the case, then it's not clear that \ref{nI:received-info} holds up, because generally reliable doesn't imply that the spreadsheet is there, though it does imply that it's highly likely that the spreadsheet is there.
    And, in this case, the spreadsheet not being there doesn't show that it wasn't highly likely.


    The things that's really important to establish is that --- hm --- I sort of want a causal relation.
    For, in testimony cases the line of defence is that the testifier getting things wrong doesn't establish a problem going via testimony.
    That is, yes, if I don't have the resources to check the spreadsheet then things are bad, but messing up once doesn't show that your testimony is bad.
    However, as stated, the condition denies \RBV{} so long as one has the resources, because the problem doesn't need to follow from claimed support, it may follow from \(\phi\) not having value \(v\).
