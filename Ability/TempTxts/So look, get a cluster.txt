So look, get a cluster.
This is okay.
At issue, would I conclude something else?
It seems by the same reasoning, because general ability, enough to say no.
Right, question is about the reasoning.
It seems the agent has an answer.
The general ability.
The same thing which gives rise to the problem seems to be the clear solution.

Issue is, different reasoning.
Key observation, got to conclude.
Problem, ability.
Solution, ability.

What we see is that it's not the premises and conclusion that really matter.
Rather, it's something to do with the process itself.
And, in these cases, the properties of the process apply equally to a range of premises and conclusions.

Note, in the def of a requ, and the build up, it's not the reasoning, it's not concluding, but the result.
Whether the agent has concluded.

So, look, because claiming support is just about concluding, the strength of claiming support depends on what concluding amounts to.
This is very important to keep in mind.

Argued via squeezing that needs to conclude to resolve the relevant issue.
Have not argued that witnessing is required.

Now we get to tension.
In the case of ability, we get all of these requisites.
And, the generality of the reasoning is what leads to these.
Conversely, the generality of the reasoning is exactly the resolution.

So, isolate what we get from witnessing the reasoning.
From the agent's perspective, this relation holds between proposition-value pair and pool of premises.
And, the agent does not need to witness that this relation holds in order for the relation to hold.
We identify this with concluding.
However, if you hold that 'concluding' involves witnessing, a question still remains.
It seems this component may be separated from witnessing.
Hence, to what extent does witnessing matter?
