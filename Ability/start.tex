\begin{note}
  This document shows a constraint on (partial) explanations of \eiw{1} an agent make a conclusion from some \pool{} of premises does not hold.
  This introduction introduces the constraint in a relaxed way.

  The main document is quite precise.
  So, here, hopefully, enough is said for you to decide whether to carefully work through some ideas.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  When an agent makes a conclusion from some \pool{} of premises, some relation holds between the conclusion and the \pool{} of premises from the \agpe{}.
  For, at least, the agent obtains the conclusion \emph{from} the \pool{} of premises.
  We talk about `\fingfr{1}' and two key assumptions are made:
  %
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., ref=(\Alph*)]
  \item
    \label{start:A}
    If an agent is in the process of concluding some conclusion \(C\) from some \pool{} \(P\), then \(C\) \fof{} \(P\), from the \agpe{}.
  \item
    \label{start:B}
    It \emph{may} be \(C'\) \fof{} \(P'\), from the \agpe{}, though the agent has not been in the process of concluding \(C'\) from \(P'\).%
    \footnote{
      \ref{start:A} already entails it may be \(C'\) \fof{} \(P'\), from the \agpe{}, though the agent has not concluded \(C'\) from \(P'\).
    }
  \end{enumerate}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In support of \ref{start:A}, when an agent is in the process of concluding \(C\) from \(P\) something ensures it is the case the agent is concluding \(C\) from \(P\) rather than concluding \(C'\) from \(P\) or concluding \(C\) from \(P'\).
  So, for example, when an agent is concluding \(43 \times 12 = 516\) from their understanding of arithmetic, \(43 \times 12 = 516\) \fof{} some \pool{} of premises associated with the agent's understanding of arithmetic, from the \agpe{}.

  Likewise, nothing about the agent's understanding of arithmetic changed when the agent began concluding, so in support of \ref{start:B}, it seems \(43 \times 12  = 516\) followed from the \pool{} of premises associated with the agent's understanding of arithmetic, from the \agpe{}, before the agent began concluding.%
  \footnote{
    By contrast, if an agent is choosing between different flavours of ice cream, it need not be the case that there is a \fingfr{} between choice of chocolate and some \pool{}.
    For, it may not be the case the agent is concluding to choose chocolate  --- the eventual choice may be spontaneous.

    If you're unsure about this idea in general, then it is fine to narrow attention to cases like arithmetic where an agent has some well-understood method of obtaining a conclusion from a \pool{} of premises, and needs only apply the method to obtain the conclusion.

    All the important cases in the document have this form.
  }
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Given an \eiw{} an agent concludes \(43 \times 12 = 516\) from some \pool{} one may ask:
  Why was the event an \eiw{} the agent concludes \(43 \times 12 = 516\) from that \pool{}?%
  \footnote{
    Stated a little awkwardly so as not to assume agency had any role.
  }

  In response one may observe the agent has a fair understanding of arithmetic, and they're on point today.
  So, when the agent started to think about \(43 \times 12\) they started to apply their understanding of arithmetic.
  And, they kept going until they figured out \(43 \times 12 = 516\).

  In short, the agent was concluding \(43 \times 12 = 516\) from some \pool{} associated with their understanding of arithmetic.
  What happened \emph{while} the event was in progress (partially) explains why the event happened.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Now, given \ref{start:A}, when an agent is concluding \(C\) from \(P\) it is the case \(C\) \fof{} \(P\).
  So, \(C\) \fingf{1} \(P\) may (partially) explain why an agent concludes \(C\) from \(P\).

  Further, given \ref{start:B} there may be other \fingfr{1} present when the agent is concluding \(C\) from \(P\).
  So, perhaps \emph{other} \fingfr{1} may (partially) explain why the agent concludes \(C\) from \(P\)?
  Or, perhaps the following constraint holds:

  \begin{constraint}{consFirst}{A first pass}
    \(C'\) \fingf{} \(P'\) (partially) explains why an \eiw{0} an agent concludes \(C\) from \(P\) happened \emph{only if} \(C'\) is \(C\) and \(P'\) is \(P\).
  \end{constraint}

  \noindent%
  In other words, no \fingfr{} \emph{other than} \(C\) \fingf{} \(P\) may (partially) explain why an \eiw{0} an agent concludes \(C\) from \(P\) happened.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  I think \autoref{consFirst} makes some sense.

  For example, consider \(3 \times 3 = 9\) \fingf{} some \pool{} associated with the agent's understanding of arithmetic.
  Above, the agent concludes \(43 \times 12 = 516\) rather than \(3 \times 3 = 9\), and in principle it seems the agent could conclude \(43 \times 12 = 516\) without having figured out \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
  So, nothing about what happened seems to rest on \(3 \times 3 = 9\) \fingf{} any \pool{} associated with the agent's understanding of arithmetic and hence this \fingfr{} appears irrelevant to (partially) explaining the relevant event.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Still, I don't think \autoref{consFirst} makes complete sense.

  For, an \eiw{0} an agent concludes \(C\) from \(P\) may include a sub-event in which the agent concludes \(C'\) from \(P'\).
  And in this respect, \(C'\) \fingf{} \(P'\) may (partially) explain why the \eiw{0} an agent concludes \(C\) from \(P\) happened --- both \fingfr{1} were `witnessed' during the event.

  So, I'd like to consider a weaker constraint:

  \begin{constraint}{consSecond}{A second pass}
    \(C'\) \fingf{} \(P'\) (partially) explains why an \eiw{0} an agent concludes \(C\) from \(P\) happened \emph{only if} the agent has concluded or is concluding \(C'\) from \(P'\).
  \end{constraint}

  \noindent%
  Given \autoref{consSecond}, a \emph{\fingfr{}} requires some extant \emph{from relation} to be (partially) explanatory.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \autoref{consFirst} entails \autoref{consSecond}, covers sub-conclusions, and more.
  Perhaps \autoref{consSecond} is too weak!
  Still, if \autoref{consSecond} fails to hold, then any weaker constraint (such as \autoref{consFirst}) also fails to hold.
  Hence, an argument against \autoref{consSecond} is an argument against any weaker constraint.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  This document shows \autoref{consSecond} fails to hold.

  Part of this document amounts to making the idea of a \fingfr{} precise, and motivating \fingfr{1} as (partial) explains of why an \eiw{} an agent concludes happens.

  The other part of this document amounts to showing the precise variant of \autoref{consSecond} fails to hold.
  Specifically, a deductive argument establishes \emph{if} certain conditions hold \emph{then} \autoref{consSecond} fails to hold, together with supporting argumentation suggests the relevant conditions are common.

  For those still tentative, \autoref{cha:intro} contains more details and a sketch of the overall argument.
\end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   Document is centred around failure of the constraint.
%   Still, focus of the document is on the argument.

%   What I mean by this is that I don't take the failure of the constraint to be a significant contribution.
%   Instead, the argument.
%   Even if you think something is clear, still need to show it is the case.
%   And, in this case I think the details are worth working through.
%   Indeed, though tailored to a particular result, I have attempted to keep things quite general.
%   Rather than failure reducing to a single idea, failure is due to the way a collection of ideas interact.
%   These ideas may be separated and sent separate ways.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   \autoref{consFirst} is a first pass.

%   A more careful statement of \autoref{consFirst} both specifies the senses of `why' and `how' present in \autoref{consFirst} and clarifies (at least) sufficient conditions for a conclusion to happen (as used to show the failure of \autoref{consFirst}).
%   In reverse order we touch on a few key details:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     Conclusions are more-or-less those identified by natural language.

%     For example, one concludes \(43 \times 12 = 516\) from their understanding of arithmetic, a winning move in a game of chess from their understanding of chess and the state of a game of chess, and what the time is from their impression of a clock and their understanding of the way clocks display the time.%
%     \footnote{
%       Further examples are present throughout the document.
%       Some detailed examples are given in \autoref{cha:intro}.
%       And, for the interested reader \autoref{cha:clar} reduces \eiw{0} an agent concludes to a collection of definitions and assumptions.
%     }
%   \item
%     How \eiw{0} an agent concludes happen is fairly unconstrained.
%     Somehow an agent moves from their understanding of chess and the state of a game of chess to a winning move.
%     And, however this happens answers how.
%     Of importance is only that whatever happened happened.
%   \item
%     (Partial) explanations of why an \eiw[\(e\)]{0} an agent concludes happened (partially) establish why \(e\) was an \eiw{0} the agent concludes, rather than \(e\) being \eiw{0} some other thing happened.

%     For example, why was \(e\) an \eiw{0} the agent concluded \(43 \times 12 = 516\) from their understanding of arithmetic as opposed to an \eiw{0} the agent concluded \(43 \times 12 = 516\) by using a calculator, or an \eiw{} the agent concluded \(43 \times 12 = 506\).%
%     \footnote{
%       Chapters \ref{cha:intro} and \ref{cha:events-progress} significantly expand on the (partial) explanations of why at issue.
%     }
%   \end{itemize}

%   \noindent
%   On some days I find the failure of \autoref{consFirst} surprising, and on other days the failure of \autoref{consFirst} seems obvious.
%   Either way, what follows is a careful argument for the failure of \autoref{consFirst}.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   Specifically, I establish that so long as various conditions obtain, then \autoref{consFirst} fails.
%   Further, I motivate each of the conditions as either pre-theoretically useful or an instance of a commonly accepted idea.

%   That is, I provide a deductive argument against \autoref{consFirst} with strong supporting (though non-deductive) argumentation for the soundness of the relevant premises.
%   As such, significant work has been put into obtaining an suitable balance between premises which are stated with sufficient precision and contain sufficient information to entail further results while holding sufficiently close to an intuitive understanding of the relevant phenomenon in order to be seen as sound.
% \end{note}







% \begin{note}
%   In form, \autoref{consFirst} is a constraint on (partial) explanations of why some thing came to be in terms of how that thing came to be.
  

  
%   Constraints of this kind  \citeauthor{Davidson:1963aa}.
%   Rationalisations are a relation between a reason and an action such that the reason explains the action by giving the agent's reason for doing the action.
%   And, \citeauthor{Davidson:1963aa} argues rationalisations are causal explanations.

%   So, an action is explained by giving the agent's reason for doing the action only if there is some causal trace from the agent's reason for the action to the action.
% \end{note}


% \begin{note}
%   Failure of constraint is compatible with maintaining the \citeauthor{Davidson:1963aa}ian position of rationalisations being causal explanations.

%   Though I think there are two ways to purse this contrast with \citeauthor{Davidson:1963aa}.

%   The first is to consider differences in the target of the constraint.
%   Rationalisations target an agent's reason for doing some action.
%   By contrast, the constraint we consider targets a premise-conclusion relation.

%   Second is to re-examine rationalisations and similar general constraints.
%   Perhaps way failures are identified extends to or approximates other failures.%
%   \footnote{
%     In the case of \citeauthor{Davidson:1963aa} the reason included in the rationalisation is the \emph{agent's} reason.
%     And, I think the way this attribution is understood may make a difference.
%     Still, this line of inquiry is for an other time.
