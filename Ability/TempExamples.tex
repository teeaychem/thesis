    Maybe useful to include, as this shows how \zS{} is kind of weak.
    The key thing to think about is whether there is something that could lead the agent to conclude that their friend doesn't know them very well.
  }

  The same basic idea underlying~\autoref{illu:S:gifts} extends to various other premise-conclusion instances.
  Consider, for example:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The newspaper reported \(S\) said that \(p\).
  \item \(S\) said that \(p\).
  \end{enumerate}

  It seems plausible that the reasoning from premise to conclusion assumes that the paper has a history of accurate reporting.
  And, and if available to the agent are various premises which suggest that the paper does not have such a history, then the agent may refrain from concluding \(S\) said that \(p\) from the report.
  Still, even if the agent were to relax their epistemic state so that the newspaper lacking such a history is \epVAd{}, the agent may still have sufficient premises to conclude that the newspaper does have the history, those premises may resist questioning, and so on.
  Hence, whether or not an agent has \support{} for the conclusion broadly depends on the agent's epistemic state.
  Further, the agent may also have some other premise from which to conclude \(S\) said that \(p\).
  For example, by having been in the room when \(S\) said that \(p\).

  \begin{scenario}[A trip to the zoo]\mbox{ }
    \label{scen:trip-to-zoo}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{quote}
      You take your son to the zoo, see several zebras, and, when questioned by your son, tell him they are zebras.
      Do you know they are zebras?
      [\dots]
      We know what zebras look like, and, besides, this is the city zoo and the animals are in a pen clearly marked ``Zebras.''
      Yet, something's being a zebra implies that it is not a mule and, in particular, not a mule cleverly disguised by the zoo authorities to look like a zebra.
      Do you know that these animals are not mules cleverly disguised by the zoo authorities to look like zebras?\newline
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[1015--1016]{Dretske:1970to})}
    \end{quote}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{scenario}

  \autoref{scen:trip-to-zoo} is framed in terms of knowledge, and is designed to raise a problem for conclude of knowledge under known entailment.
  Intuitively, you know the animals in the pen are zebras.
  And, you know the following conditional is true:
  The animals in the pen are zebras \emph{only if} the animals in the pen are not cleverly disguised mules.
  However, you (intuitively) don't know the animals in the pen are not cleverly disguised mules.

  If knowledge is closed under known entailment, then you:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only if \(\psi\) has value \(v'\)
  \end{enumerate}

  then, if

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \(\phi\) has value \(v\), then
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \(\psi\) has value \(v'\)
  \end{enumerate}

  So, if closure of knowledge under know entailment, and conclusion is that you know, then any further reasoning, need to conclude.

  So, right now, from the current \poP{}, not counting additional information.

  Intuitively, don't know, and there is no \pevent{}.
  However, this is not due to.

  For, holds regardless of whether or not.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Still, knowledge.

  Not concluding unless knows.
  Then, if no \pevent{}, then agent doesn't know.
  {
    \color{red}
    I should come back to this point.
    For, it does seem a weakness.
    One could deny that knowledge ever interacts in this way.
    For example, possibility of no external world.

    However, if this is a concern, then it's not clear to me that there is anything interesting to be said about concluding.
    To the extent have concluded via understanding of rules of Sudoku, know that \pevent{}.
    If worried about lack of external world, then no guarantee that concluded from rules of Sudoku.

    So, really, the point is that it seems strange to break this link.
  }

  Event does not develop unless know.
  Therefore, does not develop unless there is some \pevent{}.

  Because, if do not know then will check.
  And, if check fails then will not conclude.

%   \footnote{
%     \label{illu:fc:surds:fn}
%     First, consider the numerator.
%     Each element of the numerator may be rewritten as follows:
%     \((3 + \sqrt{3})^{2} = 12 + 6\sqrt{3}\), \(\sqrt{6}^{2} = 6\), \((2\sqrt{3})^{2} = 12\).
%     By summing the elements we obtain \(6\sqrt{3} + 6\).
%     Hence, by rewriting, the numerator may be replaced with, \(2(3\sqrt{3} + 3)\).

%     Now consider the denominator.
%     Observe we may cancel multiplication by \(2\) from both the numerator and denominator.
%     Further, observe \(\sqrt{6} = \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}\).
%     Hence, by distributing we  obtain, \((3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3}\sqrt{3})\sqrt{2}\).
%     Likewise, observe \(\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{9} = 3\).
%     Hence, by rewriting the denominator reads \((3\sqrt{3} + 3)\sqrt{2}\).
%     As both the numerator and denominator contain \((3\sqrt{3} + 3)\), we may cancel to obtain the desired equality.

%   Though, if like me you may end up exploring a handful of unsuccessful ideas before stumbling across the path to the solution.
%   In particular, don't conclude any intermediary miscalculations.
%   And, keep going until solution is clear.

\begin{note}[Wally]
  \begin{illustration}[Where's Wally]
    \label{illu:CS:wheres-wally}
    \nagent{15} has a book containing numerous drawings of bustling scenes in which various characters are doing a variety of things.
    And, somewhere in each scene is a character called `Wally', identifiable by a collection of individually necessary and jointly sufficient distinguishing features.
    These features include a red and white striped jumper, blue trousers, short brown wavy hair, and so on.

    \nagent{15} has searched through one particular scene, and has identified a character with a variety of the features.
    Before concluding that the character is Wally, \nagent{15} remembers that there is a picture of Wally On the cover of the book, with all the identifying features present.

    Wally is always wearing a pair of round glasses, but this was not a feature \nagent{15} kept in mind when searching for Wally.
    So, perhaps the character \nagent{15} identified is not wearing round glasses  --- \nagent{15} only recalls the features they identified.
  \end{illustration}

  Interest is with whether \nagent{15} may conclude from the variety of features identified that the character is Wally.

  The difficulty for \nagent{15} is that if \nagent{15} were to check whether the character is wearing a pair of round glasses, and the character is not wearing a pair of round glasses, then \nagent{15} would conclude that the character is not Wally.
  Hence, a \requ{}.
  And, not a \fc{}.

  I'm going to ask whether Wally is usually carrying a cane.

  Here, keep in mind premises.
  Most plausible thing is that go back and check.
  However, this plausibly results in an additional premise.
  There is some information that is missing, and once you add it, you will conclude.
  However, not from present information.

  Two ways in which this works.

  First, soundness of `Squish'-elimination.

  Second, from basic rules.

\begin{note}[Spot the difference]
  \begin{illustration}[Spot the difference]
    \label{illu:CS:spot-the-diff}
    The agent has been working through a spot-the-difference to pass some time.

    Though the time is not completely passed, the agent examined the two images with what seems sufficient care to claim support that they have found all the differences.
    However, the agent did not keep track of the number of differences.

    The agent announces `I have found all the differences' and their companion responds `All fifteen?'

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(I\ref{illu:CS:spot-the-diff}.\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{-1}
    \item
      \label{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:info}
      If I have found all the differences, I have found fifteen differences.
    \end{enumerate}

    The agent then reasons as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(I\ref{illu:CS:spot-the-diff}.\arabic*), resume]
    \item Exhaustive search.
    \item
      \label{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:all}
      I found all the differences.
    \item
      \label{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:fif}
      So, I have found fifteen differences. \hfill (From \ref{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:info} and \ref{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:all})
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{illustration}

  So, as doing the exhaustive search, get this information.

  Here, plausibly a \wit{}.
  For, proposition is just a state of affairs.
  These are the same state of affairs.

  Ugh, too messy.

\begin{note}
  \begin{illustration}
    A search for `Measurement Theory' via the LCC `H61 .R593' returned no results.

    Consider the possibility that library does not use DDC indexing.

    Checked the indexing system, do not conclude the library does not have a copy of `Measurement Theory'.
  \end{illustration}

  So, this is type B because there is no clear entailment.
  However, incompatible, as then may have searched.
  Indeed, this is just a variant on lost keys.
