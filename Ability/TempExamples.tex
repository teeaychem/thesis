    An agent presses the `hint' button next to the Sudoku grid shown in~\autoref{fig:sudoku:grid}
    The Sudoku grid is updated as in~\autoref{fig:sudoku:hint}.

    The agent concludes that the current state of the grid rules out \(1\) as a candidate for the bottom left cell of the bottom left square.

    \item S knows me very well.
    \item Whatever S has gifted me satisfies some desire I have.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{illustration}
  Perhaps wishful thinking, but fine with respect to \zS{}.

  {
    \color{red}
    Maybe useful to include, as this shows how \zS{} is kind of weak.
    The key thing to think about is whether there is something that could lead the agent to conclude that their friend doesn't know them very well.
  }

  The same basic idea underlying~\autoref{illu:S:gifts} extends to various other premise-conclusion instances.
  Consider, for example:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The newspaper reported \(S\) said that \(p\).
  \item \(S\) said that \(p\).
  \end{enumerate}

  It seems plausible that the reasoning from premise to conclusion assumes that the paper has a history of accurate reporting.
  And, and if available to the agent are various premises which suggest that the paper does not have such a history, then the agent may refrain from concluding \(S\) said that \(p\) from the report.
  Still, even if the agent were to relax their epistemic state so that the newspaper lacking such a history is \epVAd{}, the agent may still have sufficient premises to conclude that the newspaper does have the history, those premises may resist questioning, and so on.
  Hence, whether or not an agent has \support{} for the conclusion broadly depends on the agent's epistemic state.
  Further, the agent may also have some other premise from which to conclude \(S\) said that \(p\).
  For example, by having been in the room when \(S\) said that \(p\).

  Similar to verifying an algorithm may be implemented.
  Break down all of the steps in the algorithm, and then ensure that it is possible to express each of the steps in the programming language of choice.

  Fortran 77 does not support recursion, a function may not call an instance of itself.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    This is not to say that one may not compute factorials using Fortran 77.
    It's a Turing complete language.
    However, would require a different (non-recursive) algorithm.
  }
  By contrast, the recursive factorial algorithm may implemented in languages that support recursion, such as Lisp or Python.

\begin{note}[Spot the difference]
  \begin{illustration}[Spot the difference]
    \label{illu:CS:spot-the-diff}
    The agent has been working through a spot-the-difference to pass some time.

    Though the time is not completely passed, the agent examined the two images with what seems sufficient care to claim support that they have found all the differences.
    However, the agent did not keep track of the number of differences.

    The agent announces `I have found all the differences' and their companion responds `All fifteen?'.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(I\ref{illu:CS:spot-the-diff}.\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{-1}
    \item
      \label{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:info}
      If I have found all the differences, I have found fifteen differences.
    \end{enumerate}

    The agent then reasons as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(I\ref{illu:CS:spot-the-diff}.\arabic*), resume]
    \item Exhaustive search.
    \item
      \label{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:all}
      I found all the differences.
    \item
      \label{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:fif}
      So, I have found fifteen differences. \hfill (From \ref{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:info} and \ref{illu:CS:spot-the-diff:all})
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{illustration}

  Before going further, structure of this.

  The agent performed some reasoning, and concluded that they found all the differences.
  However, that reasoning is mentioned but not stated in the \illu{0}.
  Rather, present is distinct instance of reasoning after being provided with information.
  ``If not 15, then problem''.
  Present reasoning appeals to past reasoning, and draws out consequence of this given new information.
  Important: the present reasoning does not consider possibility that the agent did not find all 15 differences.
  Instead, consequence of conclusion of previous instance of reasoning.
  Still, epistemically possible that the agent did not find 15 differences.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Information leads to \requ{}.

  Possibility of not fifteen.
  And, not merely that the agent performed the reasoning, but that the reasoning identified all.
  If not fifteen, then not all, so would involve appeal to something that is not the case.

  And, present reasoning does not include reasoning about \requ{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  Though, this is interesting.
  For, the agent may have found fifteen.
  This, then, helps stress the point that it's not just reasoning to the conclusion.

% % % Wally % % %

\begin{note}[Wally]
  \begin{illustration}[Where's Wally]
    \label{illu:CS:wheres-wally}
    \nagent{15} has a book containing numerous drawings of bustling scenes in which various characters are doing a variety of things.
    And, somewhere in each scene is a character called `Wally', identifiable by a collection of individually necessary and jointly sufficient distinguishing features.
    These features include a red and white striped jumper, blue trousers, short brown wavy hair, and so on.

    \nagent{15} has searched through one particular scene, and has identified a character with a variety of the features.
    Before concluding that the character is Wally, \nagent{15} remembers that there is a picture of Wally On the cover of the book, with all the identifying features present.

    Wally is always wearing a pair of round glasses, but this was not a feature \nagent{15} kept in mind when searching for Wally, and it is \epVAd{} for \nagent{15} that the character they identified is not wearing round glasses  --- \nagent{15} only recalls the features they identified.
  \end{illustration}

  Our interest is, generally, in whether \nagent{15} may conclude from the variety of features identified that the character is Wally.

  Descriptively, of course, there seems no barrier.
  An agent may reason to an arbitrary conclusion to arbitrary premises.

  So, specifically, our interest is in whether \nagent{15} would claim support that the character is Wally by concluding that the character is Wally from the variety of features identified.

  The difficulty for \nagent{15} is that so long as they consider it \epVAd{} that the character is not wearing round glasses, then there a clear check on whether \nagent{15} may reason to a different conclusion.
  For, if \nagent{15} were to check whether the character is wearing a pair of round glasses, and the character is not wearing a pair of round glasses, then \nagent{15} would conclude that the character is not Wally.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  {
    \color{red}
    Here, revise the Wally scenario to involve reasoning about the characteristic features of Wally from memory.

    Part of the interest here, then, is that in some cases there is an `internal parallel' to doing something that doesn't involve reasoning.

%   Strengthen, doubts about the clock.

%   From perspective, time in 9:15a.
%   But, this can't be quite right.
%   Nothing beyond perspective.
%   Operative, links to action of rushing around.
%   But, perspective is not that the time is 9:15a because I don't do anything other than treat the time as being 9:15a.

%   Here, I think it's plausible that from the agent's perspective, 9:15a, but at the same time, the agent's reasoning is sufficiently detached from whether it is 9:15a.
%   Perspective matters, but content of perspective does not matter.

\paragraph{Has concluded example}

\begin{note}
  For example, suppose I concluded that Riga is the capital of Latvia by studying a map.
  Now, at present, I am asked by a friend what the capital of Latvia is.
  I takes me a moment, but I recall from memory studying the map and concluding that Riga is the capital of Latvia.
  Hence, I (re-)conclude that Riga is the capital of Latvia, and I do so from the relevant premises involved when studying the map.
