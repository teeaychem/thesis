  \begin{proposition}[\eiSC{-} --- \eiSC{}]\label{prop:eiS:consq}
    If result of reasoning to \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is such that agent considers that reasoning fails if \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\), then reasoning is not an instance of claiming support.
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Not possible that instance of reasoning to \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is claimed support only if \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \item Claimed support for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) never requires that \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Does not extend to all propositions.
  \eiSC{} holds with respect to \(\phi\) as \misled{} is a possible defeater in cases of claiming support.
  In order to expand to premises and steps of reasoning, then need \mistaken{} to apply to all.
  However, mistaken is existential.
  So, only get \emph{some}.

  Important for later!

  I'm going to argue that ability avoids \nI{} in some cases.
  Key here is that it's with \gsi{}, which provides the agent with more information about how to claim support for \(\psi\).
  Hence, this doesn't offer a general resolution to the constraint placed by \nI{}.

  Further, it's going to avoid the problem because the agent doesn't go by value.
  Yet, this can't just be a technicality.
  There's got to be some intuition.
  Here, it's because the agent is reducing \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) to the base basis.
  The issue with \RBV{} is that it separates.
