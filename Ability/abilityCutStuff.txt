  \begin{proposition}[\eiSC{-} --- \eiSC{}]\label{prop:eiS:consq}
    If result of reasoning to \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is such that agent considers that reasoning fails if \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\), then reasoning is not an instance of claiming support.
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Not possible that instance of reasoning to \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is claimed support only if \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \item Claimed support for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) never requires that \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Does not extend to all propositions.
  \eiSC{} holds with respect to \(\phi\) as \misled{} is a possible defeater in cases of claiming support.
  In order to expand to premises and steps of reasoning, then need \mistaken{} to apply to all.
  However, mistaken is existential.
  So, only get \emph{some}.
