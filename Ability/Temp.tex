\subsection{Deviance}
\label{sec:deviance}

\begin{note}
  Here, causal deviance.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Problem is, there's no way to guarantee a link between positive answer to \qzS{} and the agent concluding or not refraining from concluding.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Argument relies on tying content to explanation.

  In this respect, there is room for an objection.
  Deviant causal chains.
  Point here is that there are cases where these come apart.

  This isn't only a problem for causal theories of reasoning.
  The point is, some instantiation, and so long as act may be caused by something else, then possibly caused by the instantiation.

  So, possible here.

  Well, hold on.
  What is need is the relevance of the content.
  For this objection to work, need to take a theoretical perspective.
  See, in Davidson's case, the idea is fusing these two things together.
  We answer two different questions with a common thing viewed in two ways.

  Still, I think the objection can be pressed!
  Only \emph{really} an explanation is no deviance.
  To the same extent that potential event matters, it matters to the agent that there is no deviance.

  {
    \color{red}
    Resolution is, if deviance, then no agency.
  }

  I think this makes sense, or at least makes enough sense.
  Answers to `why', on this understanding, are tentative.

  Or, rest on presupposition that agent performed the action.

  So, contingent on showing there is no causal deviance.

  This is different to error.
  With error, thing appealed to isn't the case, but appeal still did work.
  Here, it doesn't matter whether or not the case, no work is done.

  In contrast to more typical instances of the problem, don't need to rule out deviant causal chains.
  Instead, just need one instance to fail to hold.
  One instance of non-deviousness.

  Still a problem for a compatible account which avoids.
  For, here, there can't be any direct link from perspective to reason.

  For example, \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa}

    \begin{quote}
      [W]e explain an event that is an action done for reasons by appealing to the fact that the agent took certain considerations to settle the question of whether to act in some way, therein intended so to act, and successfully executed that intention in action.
    [\emph{T}]\emph{his} complex fact, [\dots] is the reason that rationalizes the action---that explains the action by giving the agent's reason for acting.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[431]{Hieronymi:2011aa})}
  \end{quote}

  So, here, considerations which settle question, and in so settling question.
  Link between settling the question and acting.

  Following \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa}, no room for deviance.
  Too tight.

  In other words, so long as this fact holds, there is no distinction between settling the question and acting.
  Therefore, no deviance.

  Compatible, I think.
  Question is whether in resolving \qzS{} is sufficiently tied to resolving the question \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa} identifies.
  And, plausibly is.
  This is what the motivation for \qzS{} did.

  Trouble is, for our purposes, need at least sufficient conditions for when this complex fact obtains.
  And, no account of this.

  \citeauthor{Hieronymi:2011aa} notes the gaps.

  Some tension.
  These considerations aren't premises.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, the other option is to embrace deviant causal chains.
  Have the content, but this doesn't work in the way the agent thinks it does.

  Example from Davidson.

  The trouble here is that the content and resulting action match.
  So, things make sense from the agent's perspective.

  Deviant, but maybe not so deviant here.

  Systematic deviance, where content is separated from role of mental state.

  But, I see no motivation for this.

  Solution to causal chains doesn't get round this, because the result is a restricted account.
  So, there's no guaranteed trade-off here.
  Trouble is, it seems hard to see a case where this wouldn't be the case.

\paragraph{When an agent has \zS{}}

\begin{note}
  Now, two basic propositions follow.

  \begin{proposition}[When a agent has \zS{}]
    Agent and proposition-value-premises pairing.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Agent \emph{has} \zS{} for \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) after concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{if and only if}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Either:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), ref=\alph*]
      \item
        No \requ{1} of concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) from the agent's perspective.
      \item
        For any \requ{} \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) of concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), the agent would not fail to conclude \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\), from the agent's perspective.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{proposition}

  Second, when an agent does not have \zS{}.

  \begin{proposition}[When a agent does not have \zS{}]
    Agent and proposition-value-premises pairing.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Agent \emph{does not} have \zS{} for \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) after concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{if and only if}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There is some proposition-value-premises pairing \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) such that, from the agent's perspective, the agent may fail to conclude \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{proposition}
\end{note}

\paragraph{Lazy argument}

\begin{note}
  Three premises:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \label{lazy:evidence-constraint}
    If evidence for \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), then no evidence for conflicting \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\).
  \item
    \label{lazy:evidence}
    Support only if evidence.
  \item
    \label{lazy:reason}
    Support to \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) only if possible to conclude from \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) to \(\Phi\) from present perspective.
  \end{enumerate}

    Second, reasons are evidence.
  General expression found in \hyperlink{cite.Hume:1748tp}{Hume}'s \hyperlink{cite.Hume:1748tp}{Enquiry}:
  \begin{quote}
    A wise man, \dots, proportions his belief to the evidence.
    In such conclusions as are founded on an infallible experience, he expects the event with the last degree of assurance, and regards his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\hyperlink{cite.Hume:1748tp}{E.10.1.4})}
  \end{quote}

  Though, stronger formulation termed `evidentialism'~\citeauthor{Feldman:1985wx}:

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[EJ] Doxastic attitude \emph{D} toward proposition \emph{p} is epistemically justified for \emph{S} at \emph{t} if and only if having \emph{D} toward \emph{p} fits the evidence \emph{S} has at \emph{r}.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[15]{Feldman:1985wx})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}

  Read, reason only if evidence.

  Evidence is consistent.
  Take as given.

  Here we cite~\citeauthor{Achinstein:2001ub} (\citeauthor{Achinstein:2001ub}) who channels~\textcite{Carnap:1962ue}:

  \begin{quote}
    \emph{e} is evidence that \emph{h} if and only if \(p(h \mid e) > p(h)\).%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor[45]{Achinstein:2001ub})}
  \end{quote}

  Then, impossible for \(e\) to be evidence for both \(h\) and \(q\) such that \(h\) and \(q\) cannot jointly occur.
  \footnote{
    Suppose \(h\) and \(q\) are incompatible.
    \(h \cap q = \emptyset\).

    \(p(h \mid e) + p(\lnot h \mid e) = 1\).
    \(p(h \mid e) > p(h)\).
    So, \(p(h) = x\) and \(p(h \mid e) = x + y\), where \(x, y > 0\).
    \(p(\lnot h \mid e) = (1 - x - y)\).
    \(p(\lnot h) = (1 - x)\).
    \((1 - x - y) \not> (1 - x)\).

    Now, \(p(q \mid e) \leq p(\lnot h \mid e)\).
    But, expand.
    \(h \cap q = \emptyset\).
    \(q \subseteq \lnot h\).
    \((q \cap e) \subseteq (\lnot h \subseteq e)\).
    \(p(q \land e) \leq p(\lnot h \land e)\).
    \(p(q \mid e) \leq p(\lnot h \mid e)\).
  }
\end{note}

\paragraph{Pryor}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Pryor:2004ws}'s argument that type 4 over-generates is somewhat interesting.
  Details are in the following footnote.\footnote{
  Compatible with \citeauthor{Pryor:2004ws}'s objection to type 4 dependence.

  % \begin{illustration}
    % \mbox{}
    % \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{quote}
      Suppose you're watching a cat stalk a mouse. Your visual experiences justify you in believing:

      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*)]
        \setcounter{enumi}{10}
      \item
        \label{illu:Pryor:cat:1}
        The cat sees the mouse.
      \end{enumerate}

      You reason:

      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*), resume]
      \item
        \label{illu:Pryor:cat:2}
        If the cat sees the mouse, then there are some cases of seeing.
      \item
        \label{illu:Pryor:cat:3}
        So there are some cases of seeing.\nolinebreak
        \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[361]{Pryor:2004ws})}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{quote}
  % \end{illustration}

  Setting aside whether this is fine.

  Following \citeauthor{Pryor:2004ws}:

  Bad, given proposal, as if no cases of seeing, then the cat is not seeing. (\citeyear[361]{Pryor:2004ws})

  \citeauthor{Pryor:2004ws}'s position is as follows:

  \begin{quote}
    I don't think you need antecedent justification to believe \ref{illu:Pryor:cat:3}, before your experiences can give you justification to believe \ref{illu:Pryor:cat:1}.
    I also think it's plausible that your perceptual justification to believe \ref{illu:Pryor:cat:1} contributes to the credibility of \ref{illu:Pryor:cat:3}.\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[361]{Pryor:2004ws})}
  \end{quote}

  This fine when seen from the perspective of the conditional being a \requ{}.
  }
\end{note}


\paragraph{Knowing whether and knowing how}

\begin{note}
  Read the above examples in terms of knowing whether.

  More-or-less direct link between knowing whether and knowing how:

  Know whether \(?\{a,b,c,\dots\}\) know how to answer whether it is the case that \(?\{a,b,c,\dots\}\)
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Ideas regarding \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s distinction between knowing \emph{how} and knowing \emph{that}~(Cf.~\citeyear{Ryle:1946tu}).

  Now, I confess my understanding of \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s distinction is limited --- I have not taken whatever opportunities I have had to read through \citeauthor{Ryle:1946tu}'s work.%
  \footnote{
    Though, I understand enough from passing commentary to note that the idea \emph{I} am perusing here does not, strictly, require that knowledge how and knowledge that are distinct kinds of knowledge.

    Intellectualist and anti-intellectualist views.

    For, granting that knowledge how reduces to knowledge that, it will remain the case that there is an event\dots
    (See~\textcite{Pavese:2022up} for more!)
  }

  Following analogy from~\textcite{Ryle:2009us}:

  \begin{quote}
    Knowing `\emph{if p, then q}' is, \dots rather like being in possession of a railway ticket.
    It is having a licence or warrant to make a journey from London to Oxford.
    (Knowing a variable hypothetical or `law' is like having a season ticket.)
    As a person can have a ticket without actually travelling with it and without ever being in London or getting to Oxford, so a person can have an inference warrant without actually making any inferences and even without ever acquiring the premisses from which to make them.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[250]{Ryle:2009us})}
  \end{quote}

  Continuing~\citeauthor{Ryle:2009us}'s analogy, in the case of \fc{1}:
  What matters is that the agent is currently in possession of the (season) ticket.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The relationship between \fc{1} and knowing whether is interesting.
  For, as stated, \fc{1}, just about potential event.
  Plausible paraphrase.

  Whether this goes in both directions.

  So, from knowing whether, generally understood, there's got to be an event.
  However, it is not clear to me that there is a `potential' constraint on the event.

  \cite{Bengson:2011th}.
  \begin{quote}
    \emph{Pi}.
    Louis, a competent mathematician, knows how to find the n\(^{\text{th}}\) numeral, for any numeral \(n\), in the decimal expansion of \(\pi\).
    He knows the algorithm and knows how to apply it in a given case.
    However, because of principled computational limitations, Louis (like all ordinary human beings) is unable to find the \(10^{46}\) numeral in the decimal expansion of \(\pi\).%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[170]{Bengson:2011th})}
  \end{quote}

  Conversely, not clear \fc{0} leads to knowing whether.

  Issues here.

  First, factive constraint on knowledge.
  And, concluding need not be factive.

  Though, whether this matters in practice is not clear.
  For, from agent's perspective.

  Second, knowledge is not the right attitude from concluding.
  For example, focus is on deductive cases, but abductive conclusion.
  Or, some doubts about premises.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Barker:1975un} suggests:%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Barker:1975un} also, as far as I can tell, endorses the principles.
  }

  \begin{quote}
    Most theorists of knowledge would, it seems, accept the principles:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*), ref=(\Alph*)]
    \item
      \label{Barker:1975un:A}
      If \emph{S} knows whether \emph{p} and \emph{S} believes that \emph{p}, then \emph{p}.
    \item
      \label{Barker:1975un:B}
      If \emph{S} knows whether \emph{p} and \emph{S} believes that not-\emph{p}, then not-\emph{p}.\newline
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[281]{Barker:1975un})}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{quote}
  Though, it seems to me both principles should be rejected.
  For example, consider two agents, \emph{A} and \emph{B} playing chess where each move is timed.
  It's the end game, and \emph{A} believes that \emph{B} has a winning strategy.
  Further, \emph{A} (plausibly) knows whether \emph{B} has a winning strategy.
  For, an observer has determined whether or not \emph{B} has a winning strategy, and \emph{A} is capable of tracing the reasoning of the observer.
  So, if \ref{Barker:1975un:A} holds then \emph{B} has a winning strategy.
  But, the observer knows that \emph{B} \emph{does not} have a winning strategy, and \emph{A}'s belief is mistaken.
