\chapter{\support{2} and claiming support}
\label{cha:claiming-support}

\begin{note}
  From \autoref{assu:CSVP}, claiming support is an instance of reasoning that concludes that some proposition \(\phi\) has some value \(v\).
  Again, the conclusion of an instance of claiming support is \emph{unqualified}.
  If an agent concludes that the grass is wet, then the agent has claimed support that the grass is wet.
  The agent has not (merely) concluded that the grass is wet so long as it rained last night, or that the sun is not to warm, etc.\

  Still, \autoref{assu:CSVP} only places a restriction on how an instance of reasoning concludes.
  To illustrate, it is compatible with \autoref{assu:CSVP} that an agent concludes that the grass is wet arbitrarily.
  Consider:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{ex:assu:CSVP:lim:1} Birds are singing, so the grass is wet.
  \item\label{ex:assu:CSVP:lim:2} I dreamt of rain, so the grass is wet.
  \end{enumerate}
  It is not clear how birds signing or dreams of rain relate to the grass being wet, but \autoref{assu:CSVP} is satisfied given that the conclusion of both~\ref{ex:assu:CSVP:lim:1} and~\ref{ex:assu:CSVP:lim:2} is that the grass is wet.
