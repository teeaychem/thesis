\chapter{\support{2} and claiming support}
\label{cha:claiming-support}

\paragraph*{Overview}

\begin{note}
  The present chapter is about claiming support.
  Or, more precisely, claiming support and claimed support --- we are interested in both an activity and the result of that activity.

  The purpose of the following discussion of claiming support with respect to the {\color{red} overall project} is as follows:

  Reasoning with ability, obtaining some conclusion.
  Incompatible with intuitive understanding of part of such reasoning and, in particular, an common idea appealed to in various arguments.

  In order to make such an argument we require some background constraints on such reasoning.
  Hence, in this chapter we work though those background constraints.

  This then provides sufficiently precise context for {\color{red} ???} in which we state in detail what we arguing against, and what we are arguing for.
  And, provide background for~{\color{red} part:tension} in which we argue for a principle restricting claiming support (specifically \autoref{sec:second-conditional}).

  And, as part of providing sufficiently precise context will include a rough template of the considerations which motivate argument.

  In other words, context, and also preview.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Two things to keep in mind.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item These constraints are partial.
  \item Consequence of constraints that matters.
  \end{enumerate}

  Enough to identify certain ways in which an agent may fail to perform the reasoning of interest.

  Benefit of not building in `too much'.

  However, also possible to endorse additional constraints.
  In particular, rule out alternative.
  If so, also a problem.
  We will not give much attention to this.
  Argument rests on plausibility when applied to particular case.
  If agree with constraints and agree with particular case, then this is an indirect argument against stronger constraints.

\section{Epistemic states}
\label{sec:epistemic-states}

\begin{note}
  What an epistemic state is.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{restatable}[An epistemic state]{definition}{defEState}
    An epistemic state is a collection of \world{1}, with:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \epVW{3}
    \item \epPW{3}
    \end{enumerate}
    Where,
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \epVW{3} are candidates for the actual \world{}.
    \item \epPW{3} are candidates for the actual \world{}, if the actual world is not an \epVW{0}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{restatable}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \world{3}, plausibility ordering.
  Here,
  However, binary ordering.
  And:
  allow that ordering may be world dependent.
  do not require that the actual world is among the most plausible.
\end{note}

\paragraph{\epPN{3} and \epVN{1}}

\begin{note}
  In these examples, \PAd{0} rather than possible.
  \PAd{2} does not mean `likely'.

  This is a somewhat imprecise distinction, but it helps to narrow focus.
  It is possible, but not \PAd{0}, that there is no external world.
  It is possible, but not \PAd{0}, that the moon does not exist.
  It is possible, but not \PAd{0}, that the clock on my phone is incorrect.

  And so on.

  Move from extreme to less extreme.

  Plausibility is somewhat arbitrary, conspiracy theories, etc.
  Nothing in the paper rests on this distinction.
  However, clarify focus.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Not interested in sceptical scenarios.

\section{`Claiming'}
\label{sec:claiming}

\begin{note}[Introducing support]
  Initial clarification is with respect to claiming support.
  Emphasis on `\emph{claim}'.

  The thesis is not about when and why an agent has \emph{support}.

  There are three primary reasons why we focus on claimed support.

  Third, and following from the second, focusing on claimed support allows us to make no assumption about the relationship between claimed support and support.
  To elaborate, consider enthymematic inferences.
  One may hold that an agent may claim support for some conclusion via enthymematic inference, but hold that the support the agent has is understood from the perspective of the (corresponding) complete inference.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Cf.\ \textcite{Moretti:2019wx}.
  }
  Alternatively, one may hold that the enthymematic argument is an adequate support relation (at least with respect to context in which the inference was made).
\end{note}

\section{Basic assumptions}
\label{sec:basic-assumptions}

\paragraph{Simplifying}

\begin{assumption}[Simplifying assumption]
  \label{assu:simplifying:epPAlways}
  ???
\end{assumption}

\begin{note}
  Say more below.
  If an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\), we hold that constrains \epVW{1} to \(\phi\) having value \(v\).
  We assume, for simplicity, that concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) will only lead to any incompatible proposition-value pair being relegated to \epPAd{}.
  Nothing in principle hangs on this, only adding additional qualifications to the relevant ideas, notions, assumptions, and definitions.
\end{note}

\section{Ideas regarding support, and claiming support}
\label{sec:two-ideas}

\begin{note}
    In \autoref{sec:basic-assumptions} we made three assumptions regarding the kind of thing claiming support it.
  In the present section we introduce two ideas to narrow down the type of thing claiming support is.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  From \autoref{assu:CSVP}, claiming support is an instance of reasoning that concludes that some proposition \(\phi\) has some value \(v\).
  Again, the conclusion of an instance of claiming support is \emph{unqualified}.
  If an agent concludes that the grass is wet, then the agent has claimed support that the grass is wet.
  The agent has not (merely) concluded that the grass is wet so long as it rained last night, or that the sun is not to warm, etc.\

  Still, \autoref{assu:CSVP} only places a restriction on how an instance of reasoning concludes.
  To illustrate, it is compatible with \autoref{assu:CSVP} that an agent concludes that the grass is wet arbitrarily.
  Consider:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{ex:assu:CSVP:lim:1} Birds are singing, so the grass is wet.
  \item\label{ex:assu:CSVP:lim:2} I dreamt of rain, so the grass is wet.
  \end{enumerate}
  It is not clear how birds signing or dreams of rain relate to the grass being wet, but \autoref{assu:CSVP} is satisfied given that the conclusion of both~\ref{ex:assu:CSVP:lim:1} and~\ref{ex:assu:CSVP:lim:2} is that the grass is wet.
\end{note}

\section{\ideaS{0}}
\label{sec:ideaS}

\begin{note}
  The present section will be divided as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item state \ideaS{}, and \sink{}.
  \item intuition.
  \item provide some \illu{1}.
  \item contrasts to safety and sensitivity.
  \item additional observations.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\paragraph{Statement of \ideaS{}}
\label{sec:ideaS:statement}

\begin{note}[Statement of \ideaS{} and \sink{0}]
  \begin{restatable}[\ideaS{0} --- \ideaS{}]{idea}{iCSA}
    \label{idea:defs-for-CS}
    \label{idea:S}
    An agent \vAgent{} has support for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) \emph{only if}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      \label{idea:S:phi}
      \vAgent{} has concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
    \item
      \label{idea:S:sink}
    \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is a \sink{} with respect to the agent's current epistemic state.
  \end{enumerate}
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
\end{restatable}

  Where:

  \begin{restatable}[A \sink{0}]{notion}{defSink}
    \label{def:sink}
    \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is a \emph{\sink{}} with respect to an agent \vAgent{}' epistemic state \(\eState{\vAgent{}}\) just in case:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\(\odot\)1\alph*)]
    \item
      \label{def:sink:base}
      If \vAgent{} were reason about whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\eState{\vAgent{}}\), \vAgent{} would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
    \item
      For any \epPAd{} proposition \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) with respect to \(\eState{\vAgent{}}\).
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\(\odot\)2\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{def:sink:restrict}
        If \vAgent{} were to relax \(\eState{\vAgent{}}\) to \(\eState{\vAgent{}}[']\) such that \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is \epVAd{} with respect to \(\eState{\vAgent{}}[']\) then:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\(\odot\)2\alph*)]
          \setcounter{enumiii}{1}
        \item
          For any proposition-value pair \(\chi\) having value \(v''\) such that \vAgent{} would conclude \(\chi\) has value \(v''\) from \(\eState{\vAgent{}}[']\):
          \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\(\odot\)2\alph*)]
            \setcounter{enumiv}{2}
          \item
            \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is a \sink{} with respect to \(\eState{\vAgent{}}['']\), where \(\eState{\vAgent{}}['']\) is the result of concluding \(\chi\) has value \(v''\) from \(\eState{\vAgent{}}[']\).
          \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{restatable}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Whether an agent has support for some proposition-value pair \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) then, primary reduces to~\ref{idea:S:sink}:
  Whether \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is a \sink{} with respect to the agent's current epistemic state.

  Hence, our focus will be on clarifying the notion of a \sink{}.

  Our goal, however, is to not provide complete clarity.
  For, out interest with \support{} is limited to motivating an assumption with respect to \emph{claiming} \support{}, \ideaCS{}.
  And, with respect to motivating \ideaCS{}, difficulties with the details of how to evaluate whether some proposition-value pair is a \sink{} will be mitigated by focusing on specific steps of reasoning with respect to what an agent considers \epVAd{}.

  Still, as \(\phi\) having value \(v\) being a \sink{} does not guarantee that the agent has concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\),~\ref{idea:S:phi} ensures the agent has concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Though, this is both a technical and conceptual distinction.
  The notion of a \sink{} concerns subjunctive considerations about whether it is possible for an agent to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) given what the agent considers \epPAd{} from their current epistemic state, while the agent having concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) is a property that need only hold of the agent's current epistemic state, and may not be preserved under the relevant subjunctive considerations.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Intuition}
\label{sec:ideaS:intuition}

\begin{note}[Structure]
  Whether \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is a \sink{} with respect to some epistemic state is an instance of generative recursion.
  We start with some base property \ref{def:sink:base}, and then expand the property to variant epistemic states generated from the relevant epistemic state under consideration.

  In particular,~\ref{def:sink:restrict} combines of a `forwards' and a `backwards' condition.
  The key question is whether the agent may fail to conclude, or failed to have concluded, \(\phi\) has value \(v\) given the alternative conclusions the agent may make, or may have made.

  We start with the forwards condition, and then expand to the backwards condition.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Forwards]
  The \emph{forwards} condition considers the agent's present epistemic state with respect to the trivial `relaxation' of the epistemic state, and requires that for any proposition-value pair \(\chi\) having value \(v''\) such that the agent would conclude \(\chi\) has value \(v''\), \(\phi\) having value \(v\) remains an \sink{} \emph{after} the agent has concluded \(\chi\) has value \(v''\).

  In other words, not only would the agent conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) if the agent were to reason about whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\), but further:
  If the agent were to reason about some other proposition-value pair from the present epistemic state, the agent would continue to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) if they were to reason about whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

  The key point is this:
  The agent would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\), and there is no other proposition-value pair \(\langle \chi, v'' \rangle\) such that if the agent were to first conclude \(\chi\) has value \(v''\) then the agent would no longer conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

  Loosely, not only would the agent conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\), but from the agent's perspective there are no considerations that could intervene to prevent the agent from concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

  Still, in the case of \ideaS{}, an agent has already concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\), hence the primary role of the forwards condition is with respect to the backwards condition.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Backwards]
  The \emph{backwards} condition applies in non-trivial `relaxations' to the agent's present epistemic state, and requires that the forward condition holds with respect to any such `relaxation'.

  Intuitively, if the agent were to cancel some previous instance of reasoning such that what the agent considers \epVAd{} is not longer restricted to the conclusion of that instance of reasoning, it remains the case that the agent would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) and there are no considerations that could intervene with respect to the `relaxed' epistemic state to prevent the agent from concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Strictly, the backwards condition also requires that the backwards condition holds with respect to any `relaxation', though this is only of interest if what the agent considers \epPAd{} may change.
    We will ignore this possibility.
  }
  The key idea of the backwards, condition, then, is to ensure that some proposition-value pair \(\phi\) having value \(v\) being a \sink{} is that for any \epPN{} that the agent may entertain, the agent both has some way of concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\), and would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) if the agent were to initially conclude some other proposition-value pair from the epistemic state.

  Loosely, the agent the agent would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) even if\dots\space --- where the ellipses indicate some \epPN{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[The task]
  Showing that some proposition-value pair is a \sink{} with respect to an agent's epistemic state may be an intractable task.
  For, there may be no clear bounds on what an agent considers \epPAd{}, nor on how an agent may reason about any given proposition-value pair and one must cover all possibilities.

  However, showing that some proposition-value pair \(\langle \phi,v \rangle\) is \emph{not} a \sink{} with respect to an agent's epistemic state is more straightforward.

  If the agent has not yet concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\), then one only needs to find some proposition-value pair \(\langle \chi,v'' \rangle\) such that the agent would conclude \(\chi\) has value \(v''\) and would not conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{after} concluding \(\chi\) has value \(v''\).

  And, if the agent has conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\), the one only needs to find some proposition-value pair \(\langle \psi,v' \rangle\), such that the agent considers \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) \epPAd{} and would not conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) if the agent were to revise their epistemic state so \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is \epVAd{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Two small points.
  First, on relaxing, second on the relation between an agent having \support{} and particular instances of reasoning.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[`Relaxing']
  Throughout, `relaxing' an epistemic state has been left undeveloped.
  I expect the terminology is sufficient indicative to provide some intuition as to what this operation amounts to.
  Still, without a clear statement, the \emph{notion} of a \sink{} falls far short of a \emph{definition}.
  And, though attempts were made, a clear statement of the operation remains elusive.
  Now, while this leaves the notion of a \sink{}, and hence \ideaS{} somewhat unclear, the significance of this lack of clarity will be mitigated when we turn to claiming \support{}.
  For, the assumption we make regarding \emph{claiming} \support{} will not invoke the operation of relaxing an agent's epistemic state.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  You may note that \ideaS{} concerns whether an agent \emph{has} \support{} for some proposition-value pair, as opposed to whether an agent has \support{} for some proposition-value pair \emph{relative to} some prior reasoning.
  Indeed, you may observe that there is no connexion between the reasoning from which the agent concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \ref{idea:S:phi}, and the reasoning relevant to whether \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is a \sink{} with respect to the agent's epistemic state from \ref{idea:S:sink}.

  Abstractly, an agent may have concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from some reasoning, but the reasoning relies on particulars of the agent's prior epistemic state, and given some further relaxation of the agent's prior epistemic state, the agent may have concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from a quite distinct line of reasoning.

  Again, \ideaS{} states only a necessary condition on whether an agent has \support{} for some proposition-value pair, allowing the property of having \support{} to be tied closer to the reasoning the agent has witnessed.
  I avoid doing so for two reasons.
  First, to keep the notion of a \sink{} relatively simple.
  Second, I have no clear intuition regarding the issue.
  A detective may conclude that someone is innocent on a hunch, but have \support{} for the conclusion given the evidence they would bring to mind were they to consider the matter more carefully.
  What to say is unclear.
  Certain restrictions will be placed on whether the detective may \emph{claim} \support{}, but these will be postponed to \autoref{sec:ideaCS}.
\end{note}

\paragraph{\illu{3}}
\label{sec:ideaS:illus}

\begin{note}
  \begin{illustration}[Lost keys]
    Lost keys, searched everywhere.
    However, \epVAd{} that place haven't looked.
    And, hence \epVAd{} that they keys are there.
  \end{illustration}
  So, that one has lost their keys is not a \sink{}, no matter how tempting.

  Indeed, if I may be granted a simile, question of whether an agent has \support{} for some proposition-value pair \(\langle \phi, v \rangle\) seems like a pair of lost keys.
  For, at issue is whether there is some line of reasoning from a relaxation of the agent's epistemic state which would prevent them from concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Without exhausting all possible locations, or lines of reasoning, the keys may turn up, or one may find fault in the reasoning that led them to their current epistemic state.

\subsubsection{Closing \ideaS{}}
\label{sec:ideaS:closing}

\begin{note}[Summary of \ideaS{}]
  The core intuition regarding \support{} takes the form of the `even if\dots' test.
  An agent has \support{} for some proposition \(\phi\) having some value \(v\) just in case the agent would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{even if} \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\).

  In most cases, an agent will not merely have \support{} for \(\phi\) having value \(v\), but it will also be the case that \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  And, it is compatible with \ideaS{} that \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is also a necessary condition on an agent having \support{}.
  Still, to the extent that the `even if\dots' test is independent of the way things actually are, \ideaS{} is limited to requiring that an agent has \support{} for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) only if \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is a \sink{} with respect to the agent's epistemic state.

  Though we have developed the notion of a \sink{} in some detail, the central role of (nested) subjunctive conditionals leaves evaluating whether a proposition-value pair is a \sink{} somewhat unclear.
  For, without a detailed account of what it is for an agent to relax an epistemic state, and a detail account of reasoning about whether some proposition has some value, we lack a way to verify that any given proposition-value pair is a \sink{} with respect to an agent's epistemic state.

  Still, \ideaS{} is an idea, and further the idea may be restricted to being an ideal.
  We will appeal to \ideaS{} to motivate an idea constraining \emph{claiming} \support{}.
  What will matter is whether certain instances of reasoning, and in particular \emph{steps} of reasoning are compatible obtaining support for some proposition-value pair.

  In particular, the idea constraining claiming support will focus only on \epVW{1}.
  Hence, satisfying the constraint on claiming support will not suggest that an agent has, or succeeds in obtaining \support{}.
  Indeed, an upshot of focusing on claiming with respect to \epVW{1} is that we will avoid the presence subjunctive considerations and issues regarding relaxing an epistemic state.

  So, it is to an idea about claiming \support{} to which we now turn.

\end{note}

\begin{note}[Notion: \requ{2}]
  As with \ideaS{} and the notion of a \emph{\sink{}}, a significant component of \ideaCS{} is concealed by a piece of technical vocabulary --- that of \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) being a \emph{\requ{}} of a step of reasoning.

  We begin with the intuitive notion of a \requ{}.
  We will then work through a handful of \illu{1}, and introduce two notions:
  First, the notion of a \crequ{}, and second the notion of a \prequ{}.
  Following, in~\autoref{sec:ideaCS:requ:details}, we will further refine the two intuitive notions in to (still somewhat rough) definitions.

  \begin{restatable}[A \requ{0} --- \named{\dag \Re}]{notion}{notionRequisite}
    \label{notion:requ}
    \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \requ{} of concluding that \(\phi\) has value \(v\) with respect to an agent's epistemic state, just in case:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item From the perspective of the agent's epistemic state:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If \(\phi\) has value \(v\) then:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item There are premises \(\rho_{1},\dots,\rho_{k}\) with values \(v_{1},\dots,v_{k}\) such that,
      \item there is a potential witnessing event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\rho_{1},\dots,\rho_{k}\) having values \(v_{1},\dots,v_{k}\),
      \item where \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is neither a premise, nor an intermediary conclusion of the potential witnessing event.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{restatable}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=\named{\dag \Re:\arabic*}]
    \item
      \label{notion:requ:structure}
      The structure of the agent's epistemic state is such that:

  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  As noted, we will shortly replace this notion with a definition covering two specific types of \requ{}.
  First, however, we will consider the intuition underlying the notion of a \requ{}.

  Roughly, \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \requ{} of some step of reasoning just in case the agent has the option of concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v\) as an antecedent check on whether the agent would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) regardless of the reasoning the agent may perform from their current epistemic state.

  Let us expand by noting how the clauses of the notion of a \requ{} interact.
  To keep things short, we consider only the case where~\ref{notion:requ:structure:need-psi} is satisfied because it is not \epVAd{} for \(\phi\) to have value \(v\) and for \(\psi\) to not have value \(v'\).\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Analogous reasoning holds in the \(\chi_{1},\dots,\chi_{k}\) having values \(v_{1},\dots,v_{k}\) case.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\ref{notion:requ:structure:psi}]
  First,~\ref{notion:requ:structure:psi} holds that the agent, given their current epistemic state has not (yet, at least) concluded \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    More strictly, either the agent has not yet concluded \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) \emph{or} the agent has voided some previous instance of reasoning which concluded \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
    Even more strictly, though not explicitly stated, the above but with respect to any instance of reasoning whose conclusion \indicateV{} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  }
  For, if the agent had concluded \(\psi\) has value \(v\), then \(\psi\) not having value \(v'\) would not be \epVAd{}.

  Still, from the first part of~\ref{notion:requ:possible-psi}, the agent think they have the option of concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).

  In this respect, that \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) may be described as a hunch, suspicion, feeling in one's bones, conjecture, and so on from the perspective of the agent.
  However, that \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) is no \emph{mere} hunch.
  For, concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) is quite strong:
  If the agent were to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then the agent would rule out (from their perspective) any \world{} in which \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\) as a candidate for the actual \world{}.
  Hence, if the agent thinks that they have the option of concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), the agent is \emph{almost} committed to \(\psi\) having value \(v'\).
  The limiting factor is that the agent only \emph{thinks} they have the option of concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), and allows that they may fail to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) if they were to reason.

  Generally, any number of proposition-value pairs may satisfy the above description:
  I think I have the option of concluding that my passport is up to date, though perhaps if I checked I would notice (unlikely though I think it would be) that it recently expired.
  Likewise, I think I have the option of concluding that my bicycle tyres are more-or-less fully inflated, though perhaps they have deflated due to a slow puncture.
  And, I think that I will enjoy reading \emph{Bleeding Edge}, though perhaps it will turn out to be a disaster.

  The role of the second part of~\ref{notion:requ:possible-psi}, combined with~\ref{notion:requ:structure:need-psi}, is to tie the perceived option of concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) to a particular step of reasoning.
  Let us fix a certain step of reasoning, and assume it concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

  From the second part of~\ref{notion:requ:possible-psi}, the agent may conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) without making the relevant step of reasoning, and more generally without concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Hence, the agent thinks they have the option of concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) prior to concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Concluding \(\psi\) having value \(v'\), then, weaker (from the agent's perspective) than concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Though, this is not to say that concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) is necessarily easier than concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  }

  And, from~\ref{notion:requ:structure:need-psi}, it is not possible for the agent to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) without the conclusion \indicateV{} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  Hence, if the agent were to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\), then in doing so the agent would rule out any \world{} in which \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\) as a candidate for the actual \world{}.
  Now, if the agent were to have concluded \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) prior to concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\), then this feature of concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) would be unremarkable --- the agent would have already ruled out any \world{} in which \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\) as a candidate for the actual \world{}.
  However, if the agent has not yet concluded \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), there is potential for trouble.

  There are two cases to consider:
\end{note}

\begin{note}[First case]
  First, the agent may conclude \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\).
  As a result, \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) would not be \epVAd{}, and by \ref{notion:requ:structure:need-psi}, \(\phi\) having value \(v\) would not be \epVAd{}.
  For, if the agent has concluded \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\) and concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \indicateV{0} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then the agent would be committed to \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) \emph{and} \(\psi\) not having value \(v'\).\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    This does not strictly exclude the possibility that an agent may conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) and that \(\psi\) has value \(v'^{'}\).
    However, I will assume that if an agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then this amounts to concluding \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'^{'}\), as nothing in particular will hang on merging or separating the distinction.
  }
  In this respect, the agent certainly would not have \emph{clearly} have \support{} for \(\phi\) having value \(v\), were they to conclude.
  For, suppose the agent concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Then, after concluding \(\phi\) having value \(v\) it remains true that with respect to the agent's epistemic state \emph{prior} to the conclusion that the agent may have concluded \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\), blocking a conclusion to \(\phi\) having value \(v\).

  Now, whether or not an agent \emph{has} \support{} is a distinct matter.
  If the agent had concluded \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\), then some further reasoning may have lead the agent to retract the conclusion in favour of \(\phi\) having value \(v\).

  At issue, though, is whether the agent may \emph{claim} \support{}.
  And, so long as the above possibility it present, it is by no means clear that the agent would have \support{} for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) if they were to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Not merely in the general sense where deciding whether an agent has \support{} for some proposition-value pair seems an intractable notion, but in a specific sense.
  Specifically, from the agent's current epistemic state (prior to concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\)), the agent has no guarantee that they would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) were they to first reason about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Second case]
  The second case is a little more complex.
  \ref{notion:requ:possible-psi} only states that it is \epVAd{} for the agent to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) prior to concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  This does not require that the agent would decide whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) prior to concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

  For example, I may think I have the option to conclude that a store has inventory in stock before concluding that it is worthwhile to place an order.
  However, the `check stock' button may do nothing, or return an error --- either remains compatible with the store having inventory.

  In contrast to concluding \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\), the issue here is less pronounced, but still sufficient for trouble.

  For, by \ref{notion:requ:possible-psi}, it is \epVAd{} for the agent to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  Hence, failing to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) would lead to a revision of what the agent considers \epVAd{}.
  And, without further information there is no guarantee that the agent would still conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from the revised epistemic state (after failing to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\)).\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    If the `check stock' button does nothing, then I may conclude the store is not sufficiently trustworthy, and hence refrain from concluding that it is worthwhile to place a order.
  }
  Hence, again, the agent has no guarantee that they would conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) were they to first reason about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Summary]
  To summarise, and link back to \ideaCS{}:

  If \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \requ{} of some step of reasoning which concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\), then there is (form the agent's perspective) the possibility that the agent would not conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) if they were to first reason about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), relative to their current epistemic state.

  Hence, \ideaCS{} holds that an instance of reasoning is an instance of claiming \support{} \emph{only if} no step of the instance of reasoning has an associated \requ{}.

  In particular, for any would be \requ{}, \(\psi\) having value \(v'\), of the step of reasoning, the agent will have already witnessed reasoning which concluded (or \indicateVed{}) \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).

  And, in order to show that an agent has failed to claim \support{} by some instance of reasoning, one needs only identify a \requ{} of some step of the instance of reasoning.

  In this respect, when \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \requ{} of some step of reasoning, then the agent \emph{first} concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) prior to making the step of reasoning functions as an antecedent check on whether it makes sense for the agent to make the relevant step given their current epistemic state.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Limitations}

\begin{note}
  Does not show that there's no hope for the agent.
  Only that the reasoning fails.

  Two possibilities:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Different approach to claiming support.
  \item Reasoning that indicates \crequ{}.
  \end{itemize}

  So, \ideaCS{} is a limitation, but not a particularly strong limitation.
\end{note}

\subsection{\requ{3}: Definitions and details}
\label{sec:requ3}
\label{sec:ideaCS:requ:details}


\begin{note}[Definition: \requ{2}]
  To be precise, we refine the notion of a \requ{} into a partial definition which covers two ways in which a proposition-value pair may be a \requ{} of some step of reasoning.

  \begin{restatable}[A \requ{0} --- \named{\ddag\Re}]{definition}{defRequisite}
    \label{def:requ}
    Let \(\delta\) be a step of reasoning from premises \(\chi_{1},\dots,\chi_{k}\) with values \(v_{1},\dots,v_{k}\) to \(\phi\) having value \(v\).

    \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \emph{\requ{}} of \(\delta\) with respect to an agent \vAgent{}' epistemic state \emph{if} either:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \emph{\crequ{}} of \(\delta\)
    \item \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \emph{\prequ{}} of \(\delta\)
    \item \dots
    \end{itemize}
  \end{restatable}
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Structure of \autoref{def:requ}]
  Structurally,~\autoref{def:requ} provides two conditions sufficient for some proposition-value pair being a \requ{} of some step of reasoning.
  These two conditions, are termed `\prequ{}' and `\crequ{}' and will reduce to a collection of necessary and sufficient conditions.

  In other words, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for two specific ways in which a proposition-value pair is a \requ{}, but we do not hold that these two ways in which a proposition-value pair may be a \requ{} exhaust the intuitive notion of a \requ{}.

  Still, for the purposes of this document we will only be \emph{directly} interested in \crequ{1}, with \prequ{1} being a contrast.
  Hence, \autoref{def:requ} may be strengthened to a necessary condition, so long as the strengthened definition is not taken to capture the intuitive notion of a \requ{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Further still, the core argument of this document will focus only on the issue of whether some proposition-value pair is a \crequ{1}.
  Indeed, the purpose of defining a \prequ{} is to provide a an explanatory partner for the definition of a \crequ{} --- we will use the definition of a \prequ{} to help clarify the definition of a \crequ{}.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{\crequ{3}}

\paragraph*{Outline}

\begin{note}
  In the present section we develop what it is for some proposition-value pair to be a \crequ{} for some step of reasoning.

  Whether a particular kind of proposition-value pair is \crequ{} with a specific type of step will be of crucial importance to the overall argument of this document.
  However, for the moment we detail and motivate \crequ{1} in general.
  The specific \crequ{1} of interest will be detailed in~{\color{red} ???}, and then applied in~{\color{red} ???}.

\paragraph{Definition of a \crequ{}}

\begin{note}
  The definition of a \crequ{} largely follows the notion of a \requ{}.
  The key difference between a \crequ{} and a \requ{} is that we focus only considerations regarding what would follow from having made the relevant step of reasoning.

  In this respect,~\ref{notion:requ:structure} and~\ref{notion:requ:possible-psi} are tightened to consider on the relation between the conclusion of the step of reasoning and some proposition-value pair.
  Still, the definition of a \crequ{} expands on the relevant parts of the notion of a \requ{} in order to cover various edge cases.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{restatable}[A \crequ{0} --- \named{\ddag C\Re}]{definition}{defCRequisite}
    \label{def:requ:crequ}
    Let \(\delta\) be a step of reasoning from premises \(\chi_{1},\dots,\chi_{k}\) with values \(v_{1},\dots,v_{k}\) to \(\phi\) having value \(v\).

    \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \emph{\crequ{}} of \(\delta\) \emph{if and only if} the following conditions jointly hold:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=\named{\ddag C\(\Re\):\arabic*}]
    \item
      \label{def:requ:crequ:strcture}
      The structure of the \vAgent{}' epistemic state is such that:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=\named{\ddag C\(\Re\):1\alph*}]
      \item
        \label{def:requ:crequ:strcture:psi-not-v}
        There is some \epVW{} such that:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item
          \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\).
        \end{itemize}
      \item
        \label{def:requ:crequ:strcture:subset}
        There are no \epVW{1} such that:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\phi\) has value \(v\) and \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\).
        \end{itemize}
      \item
        \label{def:requ:crequ:strcture:propersubset}
        There is some \epVW{} such that:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) and \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\).
        \end{itemize}
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \label{def:requ:crequ:no-revision}
      It is not the case that the agent would revise their epistemic state so that \ref{def:requ:crequ:strcture:propersubset} does not hold, in order to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\delta\).
    \item
      \label{def:requ:crequ:possible-reason}
      For all \epVW{} in which \(\phi\) has value \(v\), there is some temporal extension of the \world{} in which \vAgent{} witnesses reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) (without first concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\)).
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}

\subparagraph{Expanding on the definition of a \crequ{}}

\begin{note}
  Expand on the definition.
  Start with structure.
  Leads to \ref{def:requ:crequ:no-revision}.
  Agent centric.
  Then, the core of the definition, \ref{def:requ:crequ:possible-reason}.
\end{note}

\subsubparagraph{The structure of the agent's epistemic state}

\begin{note}
  \ref{def:requ:crequ:strcture} describes the relevant structure of the agent's epistemic state.
  In short:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    From \ref{def:requ:crequ:strcture:psi-not-v} there is some \epVAd{} in which \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\) \emph{and}
  \item
    not only does \(\phi\) have value \(v\) only if \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \ref{def:requ:crequ:strcture:subset}, but
  \item
    \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is strictly weaker than \(\phi\) having value \(v\) from \ref{def:requ:crequ:strcture:propersubset}.
  \end{itemize}
  Where, the notion of some proposition being strictly weaker than another is stated in terms of inclusion.
  \autoref{fig:crequ:intuition} (specifically~\autoref{fig:crequ:psi} and~\autoref{fig:crequ:subset}) provides an example depiction of such structure.

\begin{note}[Weaker]
  That \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is strictly weaker than \(\phi\) having value \(v\) captures an intuitive sense in which whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) is an antecedent check on concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\delta\).

  Further, \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is strictly weaker than \(\phi\) having value \(v\) ensures that the definition of a \crequ{} is compatible with granting that concluding any proposition-value pair also \indicateV{} any weaker proposition-value pair.

  For, if \(\phi\) were to have value \(v\) in every \epVW{} for which \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) it would not be possible for the agent to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) without the conclusion also \indicateV{} \(\phi\) has value \(v\).\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Note, \ref{def:requ:crequ:strcture:psi-not-v} does not place any constraints on how the premises of the step of reasoning relate to \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) (or \(\phi\) having value \(v\)).
    \autoref{fig:crequ:intuition:prem-ex} depicts a possibility, but in general the agent may entertain arbitrary proposition-value pairs as premises.

    Hence, satisfying the definition of a \crequ{} will not ensure that the step is `reasonable'.
    For example, be that there is no \epVW{} where \(\chi_{1},\dots,\chi_{k}\) all have values \(v_{1},\dots,v_{k}\), and hence the agent would, if they were to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\), reason from premise proposition-value pairs that the agent do not consider \epVAd{}.

    Still, \ideaCS{} is only a necessary condition on claiming support, and in turn a \requ{}, and specifically a \crequ{}, need not capture every way in which a step of reasoning may be problematic (with respect to claiming support).

    And, as we will observe, the partner definition of a \prequ{} will place some constraints on when an agent may appeal to some premises to claim support for some conclusion.
  }

  It also follows from both \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is strictly weaker than \(\phi\) having value \(v\) and the \epVN{} of \(\psi\) not having value \(v'\), that there is some \epVW{} in which \(\phi\) does not have value \(v\).
  In this respect, the definition of a \crequ{} is restricted to non-deductive steps of reasoning.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    This is not to deny that the definition of a \requ{} may be extended to cover cases of deductive reasoning.
    Still, it is unclear to me (at least) how the intuitive idea of a \crequ{} \emph{could} be extended to deductive steps.
    For, at issue is whether the agent may have first witnessed some other reasoning which would prevent the agent from concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\), but if \(\phi\) having value \(v\) follows deductively, then no other reasoning is possible without the agent having concluded that some proposition has multiple incompatible values, or the agent revising their current epistemic state.

    Still, this is not to deny that an agent may make a non-deductive step of reasoning by appeal to a deductive step.
    For example, the agent may fail to note a key restriction on a theorem before applying it to a specific case.
    However, the distinction between whether a step of reasoning is deductive or non-deductive is made independently of the agent's perspective.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}[\ref{def:requ:prequ:no-revision}]
  However, \ref{def:requ:prequ:no-revision} captures an important subtlety regarding the agent's epistemic state that does not reduce to the present relation between various proposition-value pairs.
  For, it may be that the extant relation between \(\phi\) having value \(v\) and \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is unimportant to the agent.

  Consider a familiar situation from \citeauthor{Harman:1986ux}:

  \begin{quote}
    Mary believes, prior to looking in the cupboard, that if she looks in the cupboard, then she will see a box of Cheerios.
    Mary then looks in the cupboard and does not see a box of Cheerios.
    Hence, Mary abandons her belief about what she would see if she looks in the cupboard.\nolinebreak
    \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[Cf.][Chs.1\&2]{Harman:1986ux})}
  \end{quote}

  In a similar way, an agent may abandon any relation between the premises of some step and \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) rather than hold that so long as the premises have their respective values then \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  For example, an agent may hold that the fire alarm will active whenever there is a fire.
  Though, allow for the possibility that the fire alarm may active when there is no fire.
  However, given the presence of fire with an the appearance of no alarm, the agent may abandon that the fire alarm will active whenever there is fire in order to conclude that someone is in danger, rather than investigating when the alarm really is active.

  In this respect, clause \ref{notion:requ:structure:need-psi} of \autoref{notion:requ} would not be satisfied --- it is \epVAd{} for the agent to conclude that someone is in danger from the presence of fire without being \committed{} to the fire alarm being active.

  While both \ref{def:requ:prequ:strcture} and \ref{def:requ:prequ:no-revision} relate to the same intuitive point, these are separated in the definition of a \prequ{} as \ref{def:requ:prequ:strcture} concerns the structure of the agent's current epistemic state, while \ref{def:requ:prequ:no-revision} concerns a subjunctive property of the present structure.
\end{note}

\subsubparagraph{Relevance}

\begin{note}[Relevance]
  By relativising the core of the constraint to the agent's perspective we ensure that whether or not \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) is relevant to the agent's own reasoning.
  In particular, we ensure that whether or not \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) matters to whether or not \(\chi_{i}\) have values \(v_{i}\) by the agent's own lights, so to speak.

  Variations on the idea of a \prequ{} may take into account the epistemic states of other agents. For example if the agent were engaged in not merely reasoning to, but arguing for, some conclusion.
  Still, for present purposes we only identifying \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) as a \prequ{} if the agent considers it \epVAd{} to `check' their appeal to some premises prior to making a step of reasoning.

  This observation will be important for motivating \ideaCS{} via \ideaS{}.

  For now, observe:

  If \ref{def:requ:prequ:possible-reason} is satisfied, and the agent were to fail to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then the agent would be unable to distinguish an \epVW{} in which \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) and \(\chi_{i}\) have values \(v_{i}\) from an \epVW{} in which \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\) and \(\chi_{i}\) does not have values \(v_{i}\).
  Hence, it would seem that from the agent's perspective that they have no basis for concluding \(\phi\) has value \(v\) by appeal to \(\chi_{i}\) having values \(v_{i}\).
\end{note}

\subsubparagraph{The possibility of reasoning}

\begin{note}
  \ref{prequ:int:reasoning} is primarily captured by \ref{def:requ:prequ:possible-reason}.
  However, \ref{def:requ:prequ:possible-reason} is significantly more complex than \ref{prequ:int:reasoning}.

  In order to clarify \ref{def:requ:prequ:possible-reason}, we break down the clause in to three important components, and will discuss each component in turn.
  The three important components are:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    First, the core of the constraint concerning reasoning.
  \item
    Second, a relativisation of the core of the constraint to what is \epVAd{} for the agent.
  \item
    Third, a restriction on the scope of the core of the constraint relative to what is \epVAd{} for the agent to \epVW{1} in which the premises are true.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\subsubparagraph{The core constraint}

\begin{note}[Constraint]
  The constraint:
  \begin{quote}
    There is some temporal extension of any relevant \epVW{} in which the agent witnesses reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  \end{quote}

  Recall, any (relevant) \epVW{} is a candidate for the actual \world{}.
  And, by temporal extension we mean the progression of a \world{} up to some future point in time.

  So, at core, the constraint specifies that the agent has the opportunity to reason about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), and if the agent were to reason about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), the agent would conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).

  Note, the core of the constraint only requires that there is \emph{some} temporal extension of any given \epVW{}.
  Hence, the core of the constraint does not require that the agent \emph{will} conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Delicacy]
  On the one hand it is simple to fail the core of the constraint.
  For, the core of constraint requires that the agent would not fail to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  On the other hand, it is difficult to fail the core constraint.
  For, the core constraint requires only that there is at least one instance in which the agent would not fail to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).

  To illustrate, consider two different kinds of uncertainty.

  On the one hand, and agent may be uncertain about whether they would conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) due to, say, requiring some information that they may or may not be in a position to acquire.
  If so, then the agent will be unsure about whether there \emph{is} a temporal extension of the relevant \world{}.
  For, the existence of the required temporal extension will depend on whether the agent acquires the required information.
  Hence the core of the constraint will not be satisfied.

  Note, the relevant sense of the copula `is' concerns existence, rather than possibility, however the notion of existence is understood for temporal extensions.

  On the other hand, an agent may be uncertain about whether they really do have the opportunity to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) as any instance of reasoning may be interrupted.
  However, so long as there is no guarantee that the agent's reasoning would be interrupted, then the core of the constraint will be satisfied, even if it is highly unlikely that the agent would conclude the relevant reasoning.

  Somewhere between these two extremes is a more nuanced constraint.
  Still, in order to keep the complexity of the constraint (relatively) low, we will not add further conditions.
  In cases where the constraint is to simple to fail, then the definition of a \requ{} may be added to, as \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) being a \prequ{} is only a sufficient condition for \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) being a \requ{}.
  And, we will avoid applying the definition of \prequ{} in cases where the definition exceeds intuition.
\end{note}

\subsubparagraph{The role of the agent}

\begin{note}
  Our discussion of the core of the constraint focused on there being some temporal extension of the \world{} in which \vAgent{} witnesses reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).

  In general, whether or not the core of the constraint is satisfied by be evaluated independently of the agent's perspective on how the actual \world{} is.
  Still, we relativise the core of the constraint to the agent's perspective.

  The motivation is simple and has two (related) parts.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    First, we ensure \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is relevant to the agent's reasoning.
  \item
    Second, we reduce latent issues concerning whether there is some temporal extension of a \world{} to an single source --- the agent.
  \end{itemize}
  We expand on both points in turn.
\end{note}

\subsubparagraph{Latent issues}

\begin{note}
  The upshot of resolving the relevant sense of possibility to the agent's epistemic state is that we avoid questions about whether it is possible for an agent to recognise that it is possible for them to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  For, if it is \epVAd{} for the agent to witness reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then the agent holds that for every candidate for the actual \world{}, there is some extension of the candidate \world{} in which the agent witnesses the relevant reasoning.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    Note, this does not guarantee that the agent would witness reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) if the agent were to try, as we do not require that the actual \world{} is always an \epVW{}.
  }

  For example, it may be `possible' for the agent to conclude that the liquid in a glass is not poisoned prior to appealing to it being safe to drink in order to conclude that they should drink the liquid.

  In order to resolve whether it really is possible the agent to conclude that the liquid in a glass is not poisoned, we need only consider whether the agent considers it \epVAd{} that they may witness such reasoning.
  And, the answer may be negative as the agent expects dehydration to set in before concluding any such reasoning.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The upshot comes with a corresponding downshot.
  For, it may be possible (in the relevant intuitive sense) for the agent to witness reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) without the agent holding that it is \epVAd{} for them to so reason.

  For example, it may be possible (and quite straightforward) for an agent to check the boiler for a simple fault before appealing to the premises that it is broken in order to conclude that they should call for a repair.
  Yet, so long as the agent does not consider it \epVAd{} for them to check the boiler, any proposition-value pair captured a simple fault will not be a \prequ{}.
\end{note}

\subsubparagraph{Quantification}

\begin{note}
  Finally we turn restricting the scope of the core of the constraint to \epVW{1} in which all of the premises that the agent would appeal to when making the step of reasoning have the appropriate values.

  Key here is that the core of the constraint requires that there is some temporal extension of the relevant \epVW{1} in which the agent witnesses reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) \emph{has} value \(v'\).

  This gives rise to the following problem:
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Problem]
  In order for \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) to be a \crequ{} the agent must consider it \epVAd{} \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\).
  Yet, if \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\), then it may be the case that the agent would fail to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    In particular, whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) may be straightforwardly decidable for the agent, and hence if the agent were to reason about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) and \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\), then they agent would conclude \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\).
  }
  In which case, the core of the constraint will fail to be satisfied.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Solution]
  \color{red}
  Still, quantifying over \epVW{1} in which \(\phi\) has value \(v\) provides a motivated solution.

  For, we are only interested in the idea \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) being \crequ{} as a check on whether it would make sense for an agent to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from a collection of premises.
  Hence, in order for the \crequ{} to be a check of the relevant kind, we are only interested in cases where the agent would (`successfully') make the step.

  In other words, the agent is moving to \(\phi\), and so long as this would make sense, it says something about what the agent can do.
  It does not need to follow that the agent can reason to \(\psi\) in general.

  Therefore, we may restrict the interest in the possibility of concluding \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) to those \epVW{1} in which \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
\end{note}

\subsubsection{\crequ{3}???}

\begin{note}
    \color{red}
    Note, focus on what the actual world is is important for the second clause.
    If it doesn't matter what the actual world is, then it's hard to see why this would matter.

    `Possible' should be restricted in some way.
    This is also why recursive in the case of \support{} is useful.
    Though, also should state that it's reasoning, with no further information.

    \requ{} is split into two cases.

    \ref{def:requ:crequ} observes that the result of making the step is a conclusion that \(\phi\) has value \(v\) only if \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
    Alternatively, a conclusion that \(\phi\) has value \(v\) \emph{given} that \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).

    \ref{def:requ:prequ} observes that the premises appealed to cover all \epVW{1} only if \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Intuition for \ideaCS{}]
  \ideaCS{}.
  The notion of a \requ{} specifies how \(\psi\) not having value \(v'\) is involved with step.
  Required in order to make step.
  Then, the problem is that the step will only conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) with respect to a restriction of \world{1} which are \epVAd{} for the agent.
  The agent may conclude that \emph{if} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), \emph{then} \(\phi\), but as \(\psi\) may not have value \(v'\), the agent may not conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) alone.

  In other words, if an agent is \committed{} to it being that case that some step of reasoning in informative about the actual \world{} \emph{just in case} some proposition \(\psi\) has value \(v\), then unless the agent has witnessed some reasoning which \indicateV{1} \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then the step only applies to a restricted collection of \epVW{1}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Dynamics]
  Stated in this way, \ideaCS{} is perhaps intuitive.

  The delicate part of \ideaCS{} is dynamics.
  In the cases of interest, the agent has concluded \(\chi_{i}\) have values \(v_{i}''\) from some prior reasoning, which have satisfied claiming support.
  However, between concluding \(\chi_{i}\) have values \(v_{i}''\) and reasoning from \(\chi_{i}\) have values \(v_{i}''\) to \(\phi\) having value \(v\), \(\psi\) (not) having value \(v'\) is introduced as an \epVN{}.

  This is where \ideaCS{} will do significant work.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Relying]
  First, a subtle, but important, distinction is that the reasoning must \emph{rely} on the relevant step.
  Intuitively, some instance of reasoning which concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) relies on a step of reasoning just in case the reasoning requires both the premises and conclusion of the step to actually have their respective values in order to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

  In other words, \ideaCS{} does not extend to steps made where the step is part of some hypothetical reasoning, such as reasoning by cases.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Intuition for \requ{}]
  Key is \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is required to make the step.

  ??, ensures \(\psi\) not having value \(v'\) is relevant to making the step.
  There is not requirement that agent reasons about arbitrary \epVAd{} propositions.
  With respect to \ideaCS{}, keep things simple.
  Though, when defining a \requ{} in ???, strengthen somewhat.

  ??, reduces issues concerning the step to premises and conclusion of the step.

  ??, expands with respect to the agent's epistemic state.
  The use of the term `\committed{}' is to surpass any form of recognition.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Of course, it may be that the agent has \support{}.
  However, the reasoning would performed would not be suitable.
  Hence, failure of \emph{claiming} \support{}.

  Following \ideaS{}, \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is not a \sink{} with respect to \epVW{1}.
  Alternatively, it is not clear that the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
\end{note}

\paragraph{\illu{3}}

\begin{note}
  Some \illu{1}.
  Three \illu{1}.
  In each, reasoning which fails to satisfy \ideaCS{}, then suggested reasoning that would satisfy.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Observe, however, that the intuitive problem is not that the agent has any reason(ing) to think that \nagent{11} is \emph{not} trustworthy when speaking on matters regarding their personal character.

  Rather, the intuitive problem is that the agent does not have any reason(ing) to think that \nagent{11} \emph{is} trustworthy when speaking on matters regarding their personal character.

  In particular, that that \nagent{11} is not trustworthy when speaking on matters regarding their personal character is simply a possibility.
  It may be the case that \nagent{11} is trustworthy.\nolinebreak
  \footnote{
    \color{red}
    It's not like this suggests that they are not trustworthy.
    Asking for directions.
    These are fine, but addition is not.
  }
\end{note}

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

\begin{note}
  Goal of this section is to argue that \ideaCS{} does not over-generate.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The basic point is that while \(\psi\) is a consequence of \(\phi\), it's also the case that \(\phi\) is stronger.
  And, that the agent doesn't need to establish something so strong.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The bag contains green balls.
  The bag does not contain any red balls.

  Well, possible to empty the bag.

  However, \crequ{} doesn't cover this case, because the latter is not strictly weaker than the former.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  X has at least \(\$100\).
  Well, then, X has at least \(\$1\), etc.

  Here, something nested.
  Where, it's always possible to check something weaker.

  It's hard to think of a compelling case.
  Still, the structure should be clear.

  Now, this does not mean that it is not possible for an agent to conclude some intermediary without previous.
  For, what the agent appeals to for an intermediary may also cover previous.
  Saw with \(\$50\), and this \indicateV{} \(\$50 - x\).

  What matters is that there's some jump, and an antecedent check on whether that jump makes sense that the agent hasn't considered.
  Yet \(\$50\) clearly works for all previous checks.
\end{note}

\subsection{\prequ{3}}
\label{sec:prequ3}

\begin{note}
  Definition of a \requ{} focused on particular structure.
  However, only a sufficient condition.
  Here, we consider \prequ{}.
  Observe this places further constraints.
  However, stronger.
  Any \prequ{} is a \crequ{}.
  Note, however, vice-versa.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:requ:prequ}
  \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \emph{\prequ{}} of \(\delta\) \emph{if and only if} the following conditions jointly hold:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=\named{P\(\Re\):\arabic*}]
  \item
    \label{def:requ:prequ:strcture}
    The structure of the \vAgent{}' epistemic state is such that:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=\named{P\(\Re\):1\alph*}]
    \item
      \label{def:requ:prequ:strcture:psi-not-v}
      There is some \epVW{} such that:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\).
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      \label{def:requ:prequ:strcture:chi-subset-psi}
      There is no \epVW{} such that:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \(\chi_{i}\) have value \(v_{i}\) and \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\)
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      \label{def:requ:prequ:strcture:chi-propersubset-psi}
      There is some \epVW{} such that:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) and some \(\chi_{i}\) does not have value \(v_{i}\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \label{def:requ:prequ:no-revision}
    It is not the case that the agent would revise their epistemic state so that \ref{def:requ:prequ:strcture:chi-subset-psi} does not hold (in order to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\delta\)).
  \item
    \label{def:requ:prequ:possible-reason}
    For all \epVW{} in which \(\chi_{i}\) have values \(v_{i}\), there is some temporal extension of the \world{} in which \vAgent{} witnesses reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Idea}

\begin{note}
  Intuitively, \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \prequ{} of some step of reasoning just in case:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
  \item
    \label{prequ:int:structure}
    \(\psi\) not having value \(v'\) is \epVAd{} and the relevant \emph{premise} proposition-value pairs of the step are paired only if \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), and
  \item
    \label{prequ:int:reasoning}
    It is possible, given the agent's epistemic state, for the agent to conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) prior to making the step of reasoning.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{note}

\paragraph{The structure}

\begin{note}
  \ref{prequ:int:structure} is primarily captured by \ref{def:requ:prequ:strcture}, where:

  \ref{def:requ:prequ:strcture:psi-not-v} ensures that \(\psi\) may not have value \(v'\).
  And, \ref{def:requ:prequ:strcture:chi-subset-psi} together with \ref{def:requ:prequ:strcture:chi-propersubset-psi} ensure that the \world{1} in which the premise proposition-value pairs holds are a subset (from \ref{def:requ:prequ:strcture:chi-subset-psi}) and moreover a \emph{proper} subset (from \ref{def:requ:prequ:strcture:chi-propersubset-psi}) of the \world{1} in which \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).

\paragraph{Not completely trivial}

\begin{note}
  Trivially satisfied if the agent has concluded for each of the premises.
  For, given that \(\psi\) is strictly weaker than the premises, any reasoning for the premises is going to \indicateV{} \(\psi\).

  In this respect, fault is local to the reasoning, and again motivation for broadening to subjunctive considerations regarding relaxing and agent's epistemic state.

  Final: Not completely trivial.
  For, it may be the case that it is not possible for the agent to reason to one of the premises, but that \(\psi\) is still a condition that they could reason to.

  Or, that it's not clearly daylight outside.

  Not here that it's not clear that the clock would be particularly good.
  However, with respect to constraints, it's fine.

\subsubsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

\begin{note}
  Provided clarification and some intuition.
  Seen some \illu{1}.
  Turn to motivation.

  Recap \ideaS{}, \support{}.
  Show how \ideaCS{} is motivated by \ideaS{}.
  Suggest that \ideaCS{} also motivates \ideaS{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  First, this idea of claiming support is for how things are.
  If \epVW{}, then not for how things are.

  The difficulty is that we have no placed any constraints on reasoning.
  Specifically, steps of reasoning.
  Without preventing certain steps of reasoning, there is no problem with agent arbitrarily concluding that some proposition \(\phi\) has some value \(v\).

  Hence, \ideaS{} provided a partial constraint on the result of reasoning.
  We noted that this may still allow arbitrary reasoning, but \ideaS{} places some limits.
  Secures the conclusion with respect to the agent's epistemic state.
  What it is, in part, for the agent's reasoning to conclude something about how things are.
  Even if things were some other way, the agent would still reason to the relevant conclusion.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Getting \ideaCS{} from \ideaS{}]
  Key property from \ideaS{} is that if an agent would not reason, then no \support{}.
  This is what matters.
  If agent fails to satisfy necessary condition of \ideaCS{}, then the reasoning would not be an instance of reasoning suitable for \support{}.

  For, suppose antecedent conditions.
  But, no reasoning.

  Then, given this, need \(\psi\) to have value \(v'\), but no reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).

  Now, this leaves open the possibility that if the agent were to reason about whether \(\psi\) has value \(v'\), then the agent would conclude \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\).
  Indeed, \(\psi\) not having value \(v'\) may be a \sink{} with respect to the agent's epistemic state.
  Recall, the idea is that if the agent were to reason about\dots

  So, this means that the agent has no guarantee \(\phi\) having value \(v\) is a sink.

  Hence, lacking that the agent would reason even if \(\psi\) does not have value \(v'\).

  Indeed, the key part of \ideaS{} is reasoning about \epVAd{} proposition-value pairs.
  Our interest with relaxing with respect to \ideaS{} was to provide somewhat clear account of why the agent's reasoning concludes.
  Still, relaxing is important because it means that even after making the step, the agent would not necessarily have \support{}.

  Of course, still problem of whether the agent has \support{} for current epistemic state.
  However, only a necessary condition.

  Still, so long as agent satisfies \ideaCS{} for all reasoning, then plausible support.
  This is the converse.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  From empty epistemic state.
  Satisfy \ideaCS{}.
  Then, plausibly support.
  As, reasoning about any \requ{}.
  So, if the agent were to relax, they would repeat same reasoning.
  Nothing would be `overlooked'.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  For, the underlying issue is that if no motivation for \(\psi\) having value \(v'\), then no account of why the step of reasoning is about how things actually are, rather than what follows from a restriction of how things actually are.
  \(\psi\) not having value \(v'\) remains a candidate, and so long as this is the case, then concluding \(\xi\) has value \(v''\) is not a conclusion about what is the case.

  Hence, if every step of reasoning satisfies \ideaCS{} from \epPAd{} \world{}, and the reasoning for \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is sufficient, then it seems \ideaS{} will also be satisfied.
\end{note}

\subsection{\FCS{}}
\label{sec:fcs-2}

\begin{note}
  \begin{restatable}[\FCS{0}  --- \FCS{}]{proposition}{propFCS}
    \label{prop:fcs}
    Suppose:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) is a \crequ{} of step \(\delta\) to \(\phi\) having value \(v\).
    \item
      \vAgent{} requires \(\phi\) having value \(v\) from step \(\delta\)
      in order for some instance of reasoning (other than mentioned) to \indicateN{} that reasoning for \(\psi\) having value \(v'\) without doing the reasoning.
    \end{enumerate}

    Then:
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item
      It is not possible for \vAgent{} to claim support for \(\phi\) having value \(v\) without witnessing the reasoning which concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{restatable}

  Hence, so long as \(\phi\) having \(v\) persists, further reasoning that appeals to \(\phi\) having value \(v'\) as a premise is (also) not an instance of claiming support without witnessing reasoning mentioned in {\color{red} inclusion}.
\end{note}

% \subsubsection{Weakening}
% \label{sec:weakening}

% \begin{note}
%   With a \requ{} we have that \(\psi\) is strictly weaker.
%   However, may also think anything equal.
%   Consider the following \illu{1}:

%   \begin{illustration}
%     \label{illu:requ:import-export}
%     Suppose we have some \emph{non-deductive} conditional `\(\Rightarrow\)' and some either deductive or non-deductive conditional \(\rightarrow\) such that:
%     \begin{quote}
%       \(\phi \Rightarrow (\psi \rightarrow \xi)\) if and only if \((\phi \text{ and } \psi) \Rightarrow \xi\)
%     \end{quote}
%     And, suppose an agent's reasoning has the structure:
%     \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \(\phi\)
%     \item \(\phi \Rightarrow (\psi \Rightarrow \xi)\)
%     \item \(\psi \Rightarrow \xi\)
%     \end{enumerate}
%     Such that possible \(\phi \rightarrow (\psi \rightarrow \xi)\) is not the case.
%   \end{illustration}

%   Here, \((\phi \text{ and } \psi) \Rightarrow \xi\) is a \prequ{} of the step from 2 to 3.
%   For, if \(\phi \Rightarrow (\psi \Rightarrow \xi)\) then also \((\phi \text{ and } \psi) \Rightarrow \xi\).
%   Hence, if \((\phi \text{ and } \psi) \rightarrow \xi\) is not the case, then \(\phi \Rightarrow (\psi \Rightarrow \xi)\) is also not the case.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   In other words, the non-deductive conditional admits of import-export.\nolinebreak
%     \footnote{
%       For example, the material conditional, but not necessarily the natural language conditional expressed in certain `if \dots then \dots' constructions {\color{red}~\cite{McGee:1985tz}}.
%     }
%     Consider the following pair of conditionals from~\citeauthor{McGee:1985tz}:
%     \begin{quote}
%       \begin{enumerate}
%       \item
%         \label{McGee:1}
%         If Uncle Otto hadn't found gold but he had struck it rich, it would have been by finding silver.
%       \item
%         \label{McGee:2}
%         If Uncle Otto hadn't found gold, then if he had struck it rich, it would have been by finding silver.\nolinebreak
%         \mbox{}\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[467]{McGee:1985tz})}
%       \end{enumerate}
%     \end{quote}

%     If the main conditional of both statements admits of import-export, then~\ref{McGee:1} and~\ref{McGee:2} share the value true, or share the value false.

%     Still, even if an agent is \committed{} to import-export, it is perhaps not so clear that they would conclude that \ref{McGee:1} is true if and only if they would conclude that \ref{McGee:2} is true.
%     Counterfactuals are

%     Well, different things to evaluate.
%     So, gold was the last chance, hence the latter is trivial.
%     However, the former, need to do some work to allow for this possibility, so Otto would have had to have given up the efforts early, and so it's not clear that it would have been silver.

%     Well, maybe IE doesn't hold.
%     On the other hand, if committed, then this suggests that one is bad.
%     The second, plausibly, as reasoned about a restricted set of possibilities.
%     Or, the former, because you really shouldn't be revising so much.\nolinebreak
%     \footnote{
%       It seems~\textcite{Mandelkern:2020tc} makes some suggestions along these lines\dots
%     }
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}[The difficulty]
%   This I think is really quite plausible.
%   The difficulty is that I appeal to \indicateV{}.
%   In this sense, there's no difference between two proposition-value pairs of equal strength.
%   So, in order to have this, we would need to relax this simplifying assumption.

%   Intuitively, a distinction between trivial and non-trivial.
%   Suggestion is that different reasoning for showing for or against.
%   But making this precise is somewhat difficult.
