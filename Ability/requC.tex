\chapter{\requ{3}}
\label{cha:requs}

\begin{note}
  \autoref{cha:fcs} introduced \fc{1}.

  \fc{1} are such that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \ros{} holds between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) (for the agent).
  \item
    The agent doesn't have a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
  \end{itemize}

  A \requ{} is a relation between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) being a \fc{} and the agent \emph{concluding} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  Roughly, agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) only if \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is a \fc{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Important to generate counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.
  Still, only certain \requ{1} generate counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.%
  \footnote{
    I.e.\ one may jointly hold:
    \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item
      various \requ{1} exist, and
    \item
      answers to \qWhyV{} are constrained by answers to \qHowV{} via \issueConstraint{}
    \end{enumerate*}%
    .
    For more, see \autoref{prop:requ-not-n-ce} on \autopageref{prop:requ-not-n-ce}, below.
  }
  Hence, we introduce and motivate the idea of a \requ{0} with \requ{1} which are compatible with \issueConstraint{}.
  \autoref{cha:binding} explicitly links \requ{1} and \issueConstraint{}.

\section{\ninf{2}}
\label{cha:requs:infl}

\begin{note}
  Consider the following \scen{0}:

  \begin{scenario}[Apples]%
    \label{scen:apples}%
    Grey is walking to town.
    Grey notices a bicycle for sale.
    Grey purchases the bicycle, gets on the bicycle, and starts cycling to town.
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  The basic structure of \autoref{scen:apples} is simple:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    An initial event is in progress. \hfill (Grey is walking to town.)
  \item
    Some other event happens. \hfill (Grey notices and purchases the bicycle.)
  \item
    The initial event is not longer in progress. \hfill (Grey is cycling to town.)
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent%
  Our interest is with the detail:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The initial event is not longer in progress due to an action the agent performed.
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent%
  When an agent stops an event in progress by performing some action, we say the agent exerted `\ninf{}' over the initial event.
  Hence, Grey exerted `\ninf{}' over whether or not they were walking to town.

  Still, an agent does not need to exert \ninf{} to have \ninf{}.
  Grey may have continued walking to town after noticing the bicycle for sale.

  We define an agent having \ninf{} over an event as follows:

  \begin{definition}[\ninf{2}]
    \label{def:ninf}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{VAREnum}
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        Event: \(e\)
      \item
        Event description: \(\alpha\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{VAREnum}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \vAgent{} has \ninf{} over whether or not \(\text{Prog}(e, \alpha)\) is true.
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Both~\ref{def:ninf:action} and~\ref{def:ninf:prog} are true:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{def:ninf:action}
        There is some action \(b\) that \vAgent{} may (immediately) do.
      \item
        \label{def:ninf:prog}
        \(\text{Prog}(e', \alpha)\) would be not be true if \vAgent{} does \(b\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  Applied to \autoref{scen:apples}:

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    The agent is Grey.
  \item
    The event \(e\) spans some period of time which starts when or after Grey set out for town, and includes Grey noticing the bicycle for sale.
  \item
    \(\alpha\) is the description `Grey walks to town'.
  \item
    An instance of \(b\) is the action `Grey purchases and rides the bicycle'.
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent%
  Of course, with additional detail given, other actions may satisfy \(b\) action of \autoref{def:ninf}.
  For example, Grey may have turned back home or raided the local orchard.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The following table lists a few additional examples of \ninf{0}:

  \begin{center}
    \bgroup
    \def\arraystretch{1.125}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      Event description \(\alpha\) & Action \(b\) \\
      \hline
      Finish a book late at night. & Turn off the lights. \\
      Listen to a (full) speech. & Leave before the speech is over. \\
      Play a game of chess. & Flip the board in frustration.
    \end{tabular}
    \egroup
  \end{center}

  \noindent%
  Having \ninf{} over whether or not event is in progress is common, but there are also various events an agent does not have \ninf{} over.
  Here, event description and background condition which blocks.

    \begin{center}
    \bgroup
    \def\arraystretch{1.125}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      Event description \(\alpha\) & Background condition \\
      \hline
      Take a shower. & Has been in the shower for a while. \\
      Play chequers & Has made a few moves. \\
      A bank robbery & Is in prison. \\
    \end{tabular}
    \egroup
  \end{center}

  \noindent%
  We briefly comment on the first two examples:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If you've been in the shower for a while, then whatever happens it remains the case that you were taking a shower.
  \item
    Likewise, if you have made a few moves, then what events it remains the case you were playing chequers.
    The contrast between playing chequers and playing a game of chess is the scope of the event.
    One may play chequers (or chess) without playing a full game of chequers (or chess).
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}


\begin{note}%
  \nocite{Peacocke:2021aa}%
  \ninf{2} is a general phenomenon.
  Our specific interest in with whether an agent has \ninf{} over whether they are \emph{concluding} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  In particular, \requ{1} rely on an agent having \ninf{} over concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  Still, before turning to \requ{1} we establish there are cases in which has \ninf{} over concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  \begin{proposition}[\ninf{2} over concluding]%
    \label{prop:ninfConcl}%
    There are instances in which an agent exerts \ninf{0} over whether or not they are concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:ninfConcl}
    Consider an agent \vAgent{}, some proposition-value pair \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), \pool{} \(\Phi\), and event \(e\).

    We make two observations:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*), noitemsep]
    \item
      By \assuPP{2}, in order for \(e\) to be an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), there must be some \progAdj{0} development \(e^{\sharp}\) of \(e\) such that \(e^{\sharp}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \item
      There are often actions which if performed by \vAgent{} would result in an event \(e^{+}\), where \(e^{+}\) is a development of \(e\), and there is no \progAdj{0} development of \(e^{+}\) in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

      In particular it may be the case that:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
        \label{prop:ninfConcl:obs:2:concludes}
      \item
        \(e^{+}\) does not develop into an event in which \vAgent{} \emph{concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\)}.
      \item
        \label{prop:ninfConcl:obs:2:diffPoll}
        \(e^{+}\) does develop into an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) \emph{from \(\Phi\)}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    \noindent%
    We illustrate \ref{prop:ninfConcl:obs:2:concludes} and \ref{prop:ninfConcl:obs:2:diffPoll} turn:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Suppose \vAgent{} is playing a game of chess against an opponent.
      The opponent claims checkmate, and \vAgent{} beings to determine whether or not they are in checkmate.

      Still, \vAgent{} may flip the board, scattering pieces everywhere.
      And, with pieces scattered everywhere, \vAgent{} does not have sufficient resources to determine whether or not they were in checkmate.

      Hence, while determining whether or not they are in checkmate, \vAgent{} has \ninf{} over whether they are concluding they are in checkmate.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Suppose \vAgent{} is working on a homework problem which asks for solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0\).
      \vAgent{} starts to work on the problem via factorisation, and is making slow, but steady, progress.

      Still, \vAgent{} understands the quadratic formula.
      And, \vAgent{} may use the quadratic formula to solve the quadratic equation.
      However, if \vAgent{} uses the quadratic formula, the relevant \pool{} \(\Phi\) must expand to include the details regarding the quadratic formula.

      Hence, while working on the quadratic equation, \vAgent{} has \ninf{} over whether they are concluding \(x = 1\) or \(x = -\sfrac{1}{2}\) from \(\Phi\).
      For, the agent may turn to concluding \(x = 1\) or \(x = -\sfrac{1}{2}\) from some expanded or variant \pool{} \(\Phi'\).
    \end{itemize}

    Abstracting a little:
    There are cases in which there is nothing which prevents an agent from making unavailable some proposition-value pair necessary for the agent to reach some conclusion.
    And, there are cases in which an agent may chose to appeal to additional proposition-value pairs in order to reach a conclusion.%
    \footnote{
      It does not follow the agent had a choice over how event develops, if the agent does not exert \ninf{}.
      It may be that if the agent continued the event, they would have concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      And, may remain the case that \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is a \fc{}.
    }
  \end{argument}

\section{\requ{3}}
\label{cha:requs:requs}

\begin{note}
  \autoref{cha:requs:infl} introduced the idea of an agent having \ninf{} over whether or not some action in the progressive is true of an event.

  The key observation of \autoref{cha:requs:infl} was \autoref{prop:ninfConcl}.
  An agent may exert \ninf{} over whether or the agent is concluding some proposition-value pair from some \pool{} is true of an event.

  Our attention now turn to a phenomenon in which an agent does or would exert \ninf{} over whether or not the agent is concluding `due to' some proposition-value-\pool{} pairing not being a \fc{}.
\end{note}

\subsection{Definition}
\label{cha:requs:def}

\begin{note}
  \requ{3} capture a phenomenon in which an agent does or would exert \ninf{} over whether or not the agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) `due to' \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) pairing not being a \fc{}.

  We state the definition of a \requ{} in full, and then clarify the way in which the definition works.

  \begin{definition}[A \requ{0}]
    \label{def:requ}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{VAREnum}
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        \prop{3}: \(\phi\), \(\psi\)
      \item
        \val{3}: \(v\), \(v'\)
      \item
        \pool{3}: \(\Phi\), \(\Psi\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{VAREnum}
    }

    \cenLine{
      \begin{VAREnum}
      \item
        Event: \(e\)
      \item
        Event description: \(d\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{VAREnum}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \emph{\requ{}} of \(e\) under description \(d\) being an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      For any alternative event \(e'\) to event \(e\) such that \(d\) is true of \(e'\):
      \begin{itenum}
      \item[\emph{If}:]
        \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) is not a \fc{} for \vAgent{}.
      \item[\emph{Then}:]
        \(e'\) is not an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \end{itenum}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  As we will always consider events under some description, shorten the defined term to:
  \begin{notation}
  \item
    \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of an agent concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  \end{notation}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \requ{3} are defined with respect to an event \(e\) under description \(d\).

  Given some event \(e\) and description \(d\), \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) being a \requ{} of an agent concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) intuitively corresponds to the following idea:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) \emph{only if} \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) is a \fc{}, for the agent.
  \end{itemize}

  Or, as expressed in definition, fails to be a \fc{}, then \(e\) is not an event in which the agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  Descriptions.
  The function of descriptions is to fix some things about the event so that consider way in which the event may have been.
  Same as \qWhyV{}.

  So, then, conditional is not true due to something contingent, but from something broader.
\end{note}

\paragraph*{Lost keys}

\begin{note}
  \scen{0} in which an agent is not concluding due to \requ{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{illustration}[Lost keys]%
    \label{illu:lost-key}%
    I think I may have lost my keys.
    I usually leave place my keys on the right side of my desk, near a copy of~\citeauthor{Vickers:1989tr}'s~\citetitle{Vickers:1989tr} which I've been saving for a rainy day.
    And, my keys aren't there.

    I've searched over the desk, under the desk, and beside the desk.
    And, I haven't found my keys.

    Still, I haven't (yet, at least) \emph{concluded} that I've lost my keys.

    For, there might still be some place I haven't looked.
    If I think a little harder a figure out where that place is, I would conclude my keys might be in that place.
    And, my keys aren't lost if they are in that place.
    So, I might conclude that my keys aren't lost, which conflicts with concluding my keys are lost.

    I do not go on to conclude I have lost my keys.
  \end{illustration}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Filling in the details of \autoref{illu:lost-key}:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    I am the agent.
  \item
    \(\phi\) is the proposition: \propI{I have lost my keys}.
  \item
    \(\psi\) is the proposition: \propI{My keys are not in location \(l\)}
  \item
    Both \(v\) and \(v'\) are the value: \valI{True}.
  \item
    The pools of premises \(\Phi\) and \(\Psi\) are left unspecified.
  \item
    Key parts of description:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      If possible somewhere I haven't considered, not lost.
    \item
      Possible.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  Hence, the relevant instance of the conditional by which a \requ{} is defined is:

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      If \(\pv{\propI{My keys are not in location }l}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Psi\) is not a \fc{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      I am not concluding \(\pv{\propI{I have lost my keys}}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{itenum}
  \end{quote}

  The antecedent is true, and hence the consequent is true due to \ninf{} I exert over whether or not I am concluding my keys are lost.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  At issue is only whether \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} for me in a particular event in which I am reasoning about whether I have lost my keys.%
  \footnote{
    You may disagree with the tension I see in~\autoref{illu:lost-key}.
    Perhaps it's fine to conclude my keys are lost while allowing for the possibility that the keys are some place I haven't yet thought of.
    This doesn't matter.
    \requ{3} are for an agent, and that agent is me.
  }

  Hence, if one does not worry about the possibility that the keys are some place they haven't yet thought of, \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) would not be a \requ{1} of concluding they have lost their keys.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \fc{1} focus on event.
  However, the existence of an event is secondary.
  Present concern that applies to any reasoning about where keys are.

  This is what secures that there is no event.
\end{note}


\section{\requ{3} and \tC{}}
\label{sec:typicalRequs}

\begin{note}
  \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) being a \requ{0} an agent concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) amounts, roughly, to a necessary condition:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) \emph{only if} \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) is a \fc{}.
  \end{itemize}

  Hence, if an agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), it must be the case that \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) is a \fc{}.

  However, we have granted that any instance of a \emph{conclusion} of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) may be arbitrary.
  Two observations follow:

  \begin{observation}
    \label{prop:requ-not-refl}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{VAREnum}
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        \prop{2}: \(\phi\)
      \item
        \val{2}: \(v\)
      \item
        \pool{2}: \(\Phi\)
      \item
        Event: \(e\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{VAREnum}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      It is not necessarily the case that:
      If \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), then \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\) \requ{} of some sub-event.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{observation}

  In other words, \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) need not be a \fc{} in order for an agent to be concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  \begin{argument}{prop:requ-not-refl}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      It need not be the case that there is any significant event in which the agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

      This case follows from \autoref{obs:cds-arb} (\autopageref{obs:cds-arb}).
    \item
      Regardless of whether \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is a \fc{}.

      Even if there is some significant event in which the agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) before the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), it is consistent with our general understanding of concluding that \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) fails to be a \requ{}.%
    \footnote{
      The present point is similar to issues raised by \citeauthor{Harman:1973ww} (\citeyear{Harman:1973ww}) regarding the proposed equivalence between reasons for which an agent believes something with reasons the agent would offer if asked to justify their belief.
      As \citeauthor{Harman:1973ww} notes, an agent may offer reasons because they think they will convince their audience, not because the agent is compelled by the reasons, etc.
      (\citeyear[Ch.2]{Harman:1973ww})

      To the extent that \citeauthor{Harman:1973ww}'s point is that what holds from an \agpe{} need not actually be the case, the point in the same.
      However, to the extent that \citeauthor{Harman:1973ww} relies on an under-specification of what holds from an \agpe{} --- i.e.\ the distinction between whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from the \agpe{} or whether the agent evaluates as true the proposition that their audience is responsive to \(\phi\) having value \(v\), the point is distinct.
    }
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{argument}

  Two general ways to deny \requ{1}.
  I think examination of cases goes a long way.
  However, theoretical footing with respect to \tC{}.

  Key proposition, and then additional \illu{1}.

      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume*=propHingeSer]
      \item
        \label{prop:hinge:requ}
        \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of \(e\) being an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  The key to \autoref{prop:hinge} is \fc{1}.
  \tC{} extends \tC{} to \fc{1}.
  By assumption, concluding.
  Hence, it must be the case that we get the \fc{}.

  If this seems surprising, keep in mind that all of these definitions are in terms of the material conditional.

  \begin{argument}{prop:hinge}
    Assume both~\ref{prop:hinge:typical}~and~\ref{prop:hinge:tI} hold.
    And, suppose for a contradiction~\ref{prop:hinge:requ} does not hold.

    From~\ref{prop:hinge:typical}, \(e\) is an event.

    From~\ref{prop:hinge:tI}, \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is representative of some type \(T\).

    Now, to show \requ{}.
    Needs to be the case that, if not \fc{}, then not event.
    Well, suppose not \fc{}.
    Then, cannot be event.
    For, conflicts with description.

\paragraph*{Sound rules}

\begin{note}
  \phantlabel{squish-elimination-proof}

  \begin{illustration}[Squish elimination]%
    \label{scen:squish}%
    It is late morning on a sunny day.
    I ate a good breakfast, and drank some nice coffee.
    I have completed a handful of syntactic proofs for entailments of propositional logic using the basic rules of inference in a Fitch-style system.

    I create the following syntactic proof:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{fitch}
        \phantlabel{illu:sP:1}\fa (P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P \\
        \phantlabel{illu:sP:2}\fj Q \\
        \phantlabel{illu:sP:3}\fa P & \sqE{}:\hyperref[illu:sP:1]{1} \\
        \phantlabel{illu:sP:4}\fa P \land Q & \(\land\)\textbf{Intro:} \hyperref[illu:sP:2]{2},\hyperref[illu:sP:3]{3}
      \end{fitch}
    \end{center}

    Still, I haven't yet concluded \((P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P, Q \vdash P \land Q\).

    For, \sqE{} may not be a sound rule of inference.
    % , then \((P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P, Q\) may not entail \(P \land Q\).

    I go on to conclude \((P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P, Q \vdash P \land Q\).
  \end{illustration}

  \begin{definition}[\sqE{}]%
    \label{def:sque}%
    \sqE{} is the following rule:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{fitch}
        \ftag{\text{\scriptsize \emph{i}}}{\fa (\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow \phi} \\
        \ftag{\text{\scriptsize }}{\fa \vdots } \\
        \ftag{\text{\scriptsize \emph{j}}}{\fa \phi } & \sqE{}:\emph{i} \\
      \end{fitch}
    \end{center}
  \end{definition}

  \sqE{} is sound.%
  \footnote{
    \label{prop:sqE-sound}
    Rather than prove \sqE{} is sound (which would require a detailed statement of the proof system in question), we prove that the corresponding semantic entailment holds:

    Let \(v\) be an arbitrary (truth-functional) valuation, and assume \(v((\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow \phi) = \valI{True}\).
    Further, assume for contradiction \(v(\phi) = \valI{False}\).

    As \(v(\phi) = \valI{False}\), it immediately follows that \(v(\phi \rightarrow \psi) = \valI{True}\).
    Therefore, by the first assumption, it must be the case that \(v(\phi) = \valI{True}\).
    This contradictions the second assumption.
    % Hence, \((\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow \phi \vDash \phi\).
  }

  The relevant propositions, values, and \pool{1} are as follows:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    I am the agent.
  \item
    \(\phi\) is the proposition: \(\mathsf{(P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P, Q \vdash P \land Q}\).
  \item
    \(\psi\) is the proposition: \propI{\sqE{} is sound}
  \item
    Both \(v\) and \(v'\) are the value: \valI{True}.
    And,
  \item
    The pools of premises \(\Phi\) and \(\Psi\) are left unspecified.%
    \footnote{
      \((P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P\) and \(Q\) are premises of the deduction, and not elements of \(\Phi\).

      For, my conclusion is \pv{\mathsf{(P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P, Q \vdash P \land Q}}{\valI{True}}.
      My conclusion is not \pv{\mathsf{ P \land Q}}{\valI{True}}.
    }
  \item
    Key parts of description:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item
      sunny day, good breakfast, nice coffee.
      I.e.\ as ideal as situations may be for syntactic proofs.
    \item
      Proved \sqE{} numerous times before.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  Hence, the relevant instance of the conditional by which a \requ{} is defined is:

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      If \(\pv{\propI{\sqE{} is sound}}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Psi\) is not a \fc{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      I am not concluding \(\pv{\mathsf{(P \rightarrow Q) \rightarrow P, Q \vdash P \land Q}}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{itenum}
  \end{quote}

  In contrast to \autoref{illu:lost-key}, \autoref{scen:squish} leads to a conclusion.

  At issue is whether \requ{}.
  By \autoref{prop:hinge}, three things.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \tCV{}.
  \item
    \tRep{}
  \item
    \sqE{} is \tI{} of \(T'\).
  \end{itemize}

  Middle two, for sure.

  Though, in short, would fail to be reasoning if failed?
  Answer, yes.

  Plausibly, four \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings in type:

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      \prop{2}-\val{0} pair & \pool{2} \\
      \hline
      \pv{(\phi \rightarrow \phi) \rightarrow \psi \space/\space \phi}{\textover[c]{Sound}{Unsound}} & \dots \\
      \pv{\phi \rightarrow (\psi \rightarrow \phi) \space/\space \phi}{\valI{Unsound}} & \dots \\
      \pv{\psi \rightarrow (\phi \rightarrow \psi) \space/\space \phi}{\valI{Unsound}} & \dots \\
      \pv{(\psi \rightarrow \phi) \rightarrow \psi \space/\space \phi}{\valI{Unsound}} & \dots \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  Throughout \autoref{scen:squish} I \emph{know} \sqE{} is sound.
  Prior to \autoref{scen:squish} I have proved \sqE{} is sound on various occasions using the same basic observations made in the argument for \autoref{prop:sqE-sound}.

  However, there is a distinction between \emph{knowing} \sqE{} is sound and \emph{proving} \sqE{} is sound.
  For example, if I have just drunk a considerable amount of wine, or woken from a night of tormented sleep.
  Generally said, I may not be thinking straight.

  Of course, I may conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) regardless of whether \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) is a \fc{}.
  Indeed, given some particularly good wine I may conclude \(P \land C \vdash O\).%
  \footnote{
    For, \(P \land C\) reads `Pac', \(O\) looks like a pellet, and Pacman likes to eat pellets.
  }
  However, then not \tCV{}.

  Note, does not depend on \agpe{my}.

\paragraph*{A conjecture}

\begin{note}
  \begin{illustration}[Goldbach Conjecture]%
    The (Binary) Goldbach Conjecture states:

    \begin{quote}
      Every even number is a sum of two primes.
    \end{quote}

    I am travelling on a train with a some paper, a pencil.

    The Conjecture is only a conjecture, and so there may (for all I know), be an even number which is not the sum of two primes.

    I write down \(573402\) on the piece of paper, and attempt to find a pair of primes that it is equal to.
    Though, I am careful to ensure I do not make any arithmetical mistakes.

    I am not concluding the Goldbach Conjecture is false.
  \end{illustration}

  Filling in the details of \autoref{illu:lost-key}:

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    I am the agent.
  \item
    \(\phi\) is the proposition: \propI{The (Binary) Goldbach Conjecture}.
  \item
    \(\psi\) is a the proposition: \propI{573402 is equal to a the sum of two primes}
  \item
    Both \(v\) and \(v'\) are the value: \valI{False}.
  \item
    The pools of premises \(\Phi\) and \(\Psi\) are left unspecified.
  \item
    Key parts of description:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Not making any arithmetical mistakes.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  The conjecture has been verified up to \(4 \times 10^{14}\) (\cite[cf.][]{Richstein:2001aa}).
  Therefore, need to do a number greater.
  Careful about arithmetic, and limited time.
  Therefore, not a \fc{0}.

  Of course, certainly not proving false.
  For, number chosen lower than verified.
  Of interest is whether I am concluding.
  Answer is no.
  Not because finding two primes.
  There is nothing to suggest develops.
  For, will stop when arrive at destination.
  Rather, because not a \fc{0}.
\end{note}

\paragraph*{\requ{3} and \issueConstraint{}}

\begin{note}
  The existence of \requ{1} are compatible with \issueConstraint{}.

  \begin{observation}
    \label{prop:requ-not-n-ce}
    The existence of \requ{1} is compatible with \issueConstraint{}.
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{prop:requ-not-n-ce}
    In order for counterexample, case in which \ros{} answers \qWhyV{}, but the agent does not have a \wit{}.

    We have not yet consider the way in which \requ{1} connect to \qWhyV{}.
    However, any explicit connexion is not required.
    For, we only need to observe that an agent may have a \wit{} for any \requ{}.
    Then, the \wit{} is always a candidate for \qHowV{}.

    Consider \autoref{scen:squish}.
    At issue is whether the agent would repeat the repeat conclusion of \sqE{} as sound.

    Needs to be the case that \ros{} without \wit{}.

    However, the agent has previously concluded \sqE{} is sound.
    Therefore, the agent has a \wit{} for \ros{}.
  \end{motivation}

  Note, however, that \autoref{prop:requ-not-n-ce} is weak.
  Compatible in terms of existential.
  Hence we only needed to show a single case in which \wit{} for \requ{}.
  This does not suggest that \requ{1} are not in tension with \issueConstraint{}.
\end{note}

%   Hence, the sketch does not apply to black ravens.
%   I wouldn't conclude all ravens are black if I saw a white raven.

%   I may worry about shortly seeing a white raven when concluding all ravens are black, and I may refuse to entertain the possibility that the sun will rise tomorrow when planning to mow the grass.

%   However, it's not possible to reason to seeing a white raven, nor is it possible to reason to the sun not rising tomorrow.

%   Abstractly, at issue in~\autoref{illu:lost-key} is the possibility of failing to a reason to some proposition-value pair given \emph{present} information, rather than the possibility of failing to a reason to some proposition-value pair given \emph{new} information.

%   To the extent that problems of induction arise from receiving new information, what is at issue is distinct.%
