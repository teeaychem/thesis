\section{\dtC{2}}
\label{cha:typical:int}

\begin{note}
  Our interest is characterising an event in which an agent is concluding.

  By assumption, agent is reasoning.

  A property that some instances of reasoning intuitively have is generality.
  Some aspect of the agent's reasoning is present in the event, but is also present in other events.

  For example, \autoref{assu:concluding:pools} \autoref{assu:ConRea}, \autoref{assu:PP} \autoref{def:witnessing} \autoref{def:fc} \autoref{def:NScon} are involve a material conditional.

  Two key pieces of reasoning:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{From} \pv{\propI{If }\phi\propI{ then }\psi}{\valI{True}} \emph{and} \pv{\propI{\phi}}{\valI{True}}, \emph{get} \pv{\propI{\psi}}{\valI{True}}.
  \item
    \emph{From} \pv{\propI{\phi}}{\valI{True}} \emph{and} \pv{\propI{\psi}}{\valI{False}}, \emph{get} \pv{\propI{If }\phi\propI{ then }\psi}{\valI{False}}
  \end{itemize}

  First is useful for applying.
  Second is useful for rejecting.

  For example:
  First when considering arguments for propositions.
  Second when determining whether there is a problem with one or more.

  Definitions etc. modus ponens with assumption this pattern is recognised.
  Additional work to fill in the content, but nothing about what connects the content.

  Indicative conditional is different (cf.~\cite{McGee:1985tz},~\cite{Kolodny:2010aa}).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  I trust this intuitive observation is clear.

  For the moment we speak loosely of a `type of reasoning'.%
  \footnote{
    Not designed to use `type' in the sense of type-token distinction.
    Common characteristic.
    Though, type distinct from instances.
  }

  Means-end reasoning (\cite[60]{Pollock:2002aa}),%
  \footnote{
    To illustrate, consider the following passage:
    \begin{quote}
    \indent ``I'm giving this to Eeyore,'' he explained, ``as a present.
    What are you going to give?''

    ``Couldn't I give it too?'' said Piglet.
    ``From both of us?''

    ``No,'' said Pooh.
    ``That would not be a good plan.''

    ``All right, then, I'll give him a balloon.
    I've got one left from my party.
    I'll go and get it now, shall I?''

    ``That, Piglet, is a very good idea.
    It is just what Eeyore wants to cheer him up.
    Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.''%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[78--79]{Milne:2009aa})}\newline
    \mbox{ }
  \end{quote}

  Two instances of means-end reasoning by Piglet.
  Common end of cheering up Eeyore.
  First, jointly giving a gift with Pooh.
  Second, giving a balloon as a present.
  }

  etc.
\end{note}

\subsection{Idea}
\label{sec:idea}

\begin{note}
  Specifically, our interest is stating a necessary condition for whether or not an event in which an agent is concluding is an event in which an agent's reasoning is of some type.

  Provide idea.
  \illu{3} of idea.
  Expand, dispositions.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Abstractly, consider `\vAgent{} is \emph{\dtCV{}} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by type of reasoning \(T\)' as a predicate of an event.
  Necessary condition for predicate.

  \begin{idea}[\dtCN{2}]
    \label{idea:tR-law}
    \cenLine{
      \begin{itemize*}[noitemsep, label=\(\circ\)]
      \item
        Agent: \vAgent{}
      \item
        \prop{2}: \(\phi\)
      \item
        \val{2}: \(v\)
      \item
        \pool{2}: \(\Phi\)
      \item
        Event: \(e\)
      \item
        \mbox{ }
      \end{itemize*}
    }

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is \emph{\dtCV{}} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).\newline
      \hfill(By some type of reasoning \(T\).)
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{Only if}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      For some collections; \({\cal E}\) of events, \({\cal X}\) of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0}~pairings:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        For every event \(e'\) in some collection of events \({\cal E}\):
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item[\emph{If}:]
          \(e'\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is reasoning from some \(\Psi\) in \({\cal X}\).
        \item[\emph{Then}:]
          \(e'\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding some \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) in \({\cal X}\) from \(\Psi\).
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{idea}

  \noindent%
  The necessary condition of \autoref{idea:tR-law} is the truth of a universally quantified (material) conditional.

  For some events, agent is concluding.

  The way in which an agent concludes in other events functions as a test of the generality of the agent's reasoning in the event of interest.

  To illustrate:

  \begin{illustration}[Numbers]
    An agent is given pairs of numbers and asked to add the numbers.
    The table below represents the event as the agent responds to the pairs.

    \medskip
    \hspace{2.8em}%
    \(
      \begin{array}{ccccccc}
      x & 3 & 54 & 21 & 3 & 17 & 0 \\
      y & 7 & 32 & 64 & 2 & 25 & 6 \\
      \hline
      \text{Response} & 10 & 86 & 85 & 5 & 42 & 6 \\
    \end{array}
    \)
    \medskip

    \noindent%
    It seems the agent is reasoning by addition.
    Still, consider the event in which the request continues to an additional pairs:

    \medskip
    \hfill%
    \(
    \begin{array}{ccccc}
      \cdots & 8 & 68 & 21 & 58 \\
      \cdots & 92 & 57 & 23 & 92 \\
      \hline
      \cdots & 100 & 5 & 44 & 5 \\
    \end{array}
    \)%
    \hspace{2.8em}%
    \medskip

    \noindent%
    It seems plausible that the agent was not reasoning with plus.
    Rather, it seems plausible the agent was reasoning with quus.%
    \footnote{
      The examples borrows the definition of `quss' from \citeauthor{Kripke:1982aa} (\citeyear{Kripke:1982aa}), where `quess' is defined by:
      \begin{align*}
        x \text{ quss y} &= x + y, \text{ if } x,y < 57 \\
                         &= 5 \phantom{ if x,,} \text{ otherwise }
      \end{align*}
      \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    }

    For, consider the sub-event in which the agent concludes \pv{\propI{x plus y is 5}}{\valI{True}} from some \pool{} containing \pv{\propI{x is 68}}{\valI{True}} and \pv{\propI{y is 57}}{\valI{True}}.

    As the agent concluded \pv{\propI{x plus y is 5}}{\valI{True}}, it seems the agent was not concluding \pv{\propI{x plus y is 125}}{\valI{True}}.
    And, likewise for the final pair.
  \end{illustration}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Intuitively \autoref{idea:tR-law} express the idea that the predicate `\vAgent{} is \emph{\dtCV{}} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by type of reasoning \(T\)' applying to an event requires a law.%
  \footnote{
    Note, this is distinct from the position that concluding/reasoning is rule governed.
    \cite{Boghossian:2008vf,Boghossian:2012vb}, \cite{Broome:2002aa}.

    When reasoning, following a rule.
    We are talking about \emph{type} of concluding, rather than concluding.
    But, the object is not following the predicate.
  }

  Where `law' is understood in the colloquial sense of a universally quantified material conditional.%
  \footnote{
    For example, consider:

    \citeauthor{Helmholtz:1977aa}'s characterisation of laws of nature:%
    \begin{quote}
      \nocite{Wilson:2006aa}
      Every law of nature asserts that upon preconditions alike in a certain respect, there always follow consequences that are alike in a certain other respect.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[122]{Helmholtz:1977aa})}
    \end{quote}
    The law of large numbers:
    \begin{quote}
      Things of every kind of nature are subject to a universal law which one may well call \emph{the Law of Large Numbers}.
      It consists in that if one observes large numbers of events of the same nature depending on causes which are constant and causes which vary irregularly, \dots, one finds that the proportions of occurrence are almost constant \dots\newline
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor{Seneta:2013aa}'s (\citeyear[9--10]{Seneta:2013aa}) translation of (\cite[7]{Poisson:1837aa}))}
    \end{quote}
    The law of truly large numbers:
    \begin{quote}
      [W]hen enormous numbers of events and people and their interactions cumulate over time, almost any outrageous event is bound to occur.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[853]{Diaconis:1989aa})}
    \end{quote}
    \citeauthor{Hempel:1965aa}'s Deductive-Nomological account of scientific explanation, \citeauthor{Boole:1854aa}'s laws of thought, etc.
  }

  \autoref{idea:tR-law} does not state the relevant law.
  However, \autoref{idea:tR-law} does specify a general form.
  Our interest is with an event in which an agent is concluding in some general way.
  So, the consequent law considers other events in which the agent is concluding.
  And, the antecedent of the law allows restriction on the events of interest.

  Before turning to a pair of in-depth \illu{1}, we make two brief observations:

  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    \autoref{idea:tR-law} is not an analysis.
    Rather, \autoref{idea:tR-law} connects two truth functional statements by a conditional.
  \item
    Without a specification of the relevant law, there are no counterexamples to \autoref{idea:tR-law}.
    For, \autoref{idea:tR-law} expresses a necessary condition, and the law may be trivially satisfied by taking \({\cal E}\) to be empty.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\subsection{\illu{3}}
\label{sec:illu3-1}

\begin{note}
  Pair of detailed \illu{1}.

  First, selection tasks, not \dtC{} of a particular type.
  Second, something more open.
\end{note}

\paragraph*{Selection tasks}
\nocite{Wason:1968aa}
\nocite{Wason:1971aa}

\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} details their initial section task as follows:

  \begin{quote}
    The subjects (students) were presented with an array of cards and told that every card had a letter on one side and a number on the other side, and that either would be face upwards.
    They were then instructed to decide which cards they would need to turn over in order to determine whether the experimenter was lying in uttering the following statement:
    \emph{if a card has a vowel on one side then it has an even number on the other side}.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[145--146]{Wason:1966aa})}
  \end{quote}

  An example task is given in \autoref{fig:sectionTask}.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      cardnode/.style={
        rectangle,
        minimum width=10mm,
        minimum height=14mm,
        align=center,
        rounded corners,
        font = {\Large\sffamily},
        very thick,
      },
      node distance=5mm,
      ]

      \node[cardnode, draw] (1) {2};
      \node[cardnode, draw, right = of 1] (2) {N};
      \node[cardnode, draw, right = of 2] (3) {E};
      \node[cardnode, draw, right = of 3] (4) {1};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A selection task}
    \label{fig:sectionTask}
  \end{figure}

  \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} observes the results are consistent with the following hypothesis:%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} does not provide a detailed summary of the results.
    However, \citeauthor{Johnson-Laird:1969aa} detail results of \emph{twenty four} University College London students!
    Specifically, 19 of the 24 responded as excepted given \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}'s hypothesis.
    (\citeyear[369,370]{Johnson-Laird:1969aa}).
  }
  \begin{quote}
    Subjects assume implicitly that a conditional statement has, not two truth values, but three: true, false and `irrelevant'.
    Vowels with even numbers verify, vowels with odd numbers falsify and consonants with any number are irrelevant.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[146]{Wason:1966aa})}
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  With respect to each subject, four distinct instances of \autoref{idea:tR-law}, corresponding to the four possible features of a card.
  We specify these with a variable `\(C\)' to represent the relevant card:

  \[
    \begin{array}{rl}
      \text{\prop{2}-\val{0} pair} & \text{\pool{2}} \\
      \hline
      \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{C\propI{ has a vowel}}{\valI{True}} \\
      \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{C\propI{ has an odd number}}{\valI{True}} \\
       \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{False}} & \pv{C\propI{ has constonant}}{\valI{True}} \\
      \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{False}} & \pv{C\propI{ has an even number}}{\valI{True}} \\
    \end{array}
  \]

  Short argument.
  Begin with two premises.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., ref=(\Alph*), noitemsep]
  \item
    \label{WasArg:results}
    Fail to express conclusions.
  \item
    \label{WasArg:IdeaI}
    \autoref{idea:tR-law} as described.
  \end{enumerate}

  Link these together:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*), noitemsep]
  \item
    \label{WasArg:nC}
    Subjects did not conclude.

    From \ref{WasArg:results}.
  \item
    \label{WasArg:nCing}
    Subjects were not concluding.

    From \ref{WasArg:nC}, nothing to prevent the agent's from concluding.
  \item
    \label{WasArg:Done}
    The agent's were not \tCV{} by truth functional reasoning.

    From \ref{WasArg:nCing} and \ref{WasArg:IdeaI}
  \end{enumerate}

  Strength of the result depends on which instances of reasoning.

  {
    \color{red}

    Even if there are cases of truth-functional reasoning, something separates this from the reasoning found in selection tasks --- does not extend to all circumstances.
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Various other arguments may be seen to parallel the broad argument from \ref{WasArg:results} and \ref{WasArg:IdeaI} to \ref{WasArg:Done}.
  In particular, consider the \citeauthor{Allais:1979aa} paradox (\cite{Allais:1979aa}),
  the Ellsberg paradox (\cite{Ellsberg:1961aa}), \citeauthor{Makinson:1965aa}'s Paradox of the Preface (\citeyear{Makinson:1965aa}), \citeauthor{Kyburg:1997aa}'s Lottery Paradox (\citeyear{Kyburg:1997aa}), \citeauthor{Quinn:1990aa}'s  puzzle of the self-torturer (\citeyear{Quinn:1990aa}), \citeauthor{Bratman:1981aa}'s arguments against the desire-belief model of practical reasoning (\citeyear{Bratman:1981aa,Bratman:1987aa}), and so on.%
  \footnote{
    Consider also \citeauthor{Harman:1984aa}'s (\citeyear{Harman:1984aa,Harman:1986ux}) arguments against a strong connexion between logical principles and principles of belief revision.

    \begin{quote}
      Logical principles are not directly rules of belief revision.
      [\dots]
      Logical principles hold universally, without exception, whereas the corresponding principles of belief revision would be at best prima facie principles, which do not always hold.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[107--108]{Harman:1984aa})}
    \end{quote}
  }
  Common to each item mentioned is the observation that an agent failing to conclude in a certain way shows that other instances of the agent's reasoning does not have some characteristic.
\end{note}

\paragraph*{Power}

\begin{note}
  As observed, \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}' hypothesis extends to all instances of an agent reasoning about conditional statements.
  However, our interest is more mundane.
  The second detailed \illu{0} on \autoref{idea:tR-law} is designed to highlight the way in which \autoref{idea:tR-law} may be applied to a particular event.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{scenario}[Powerful multiplication]
    \label{illu:tR:powers}
    A student has been studying algebra and has just been introduced to the rule of multiplication for powers (\(a^{n} \cdot a^{m} = a^{n + m}\)).

    At hand are a handful of exercises:

    \begin{quote}
      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{mfp:a}
        You know that \(2^{1001} \cdot 2^{n} = 2^{2000}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:b}
        You know that \(2^{1001} \cdot 2^{n} = \sfrac{1}{4}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:c}
        Which is bigger: \(10^{-3}\) or \(2^{-10}\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:d}
        You know that \(\sfrac{2^{1000}}{2^{n}} = 2^{501}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:e}
        You know that \(\sfrac{2^{1000}}{2^{n}} = \sfrac{1}{16}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:f}
        You know that \(4^{100} = 2^{n}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:g}
        You know that \(2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}\).
        What is \(a\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:h}
        You know that \((2^{10})^{15} = 2^{n}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \end{enumerate}
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[32]{Gelfand:1993aa})}
    \end{quote}

    The student starts work on exercise~\ref{mfp:f}, and is concluding \(\pv{n\propI{ is }200}{\valI{True}}\).
  \end{scenario}

  Is it the case that the student is reasoning with an understanding of multiplication for powers?

  Answer the question by applying \autoref{idea:tR-law}.

  Consider the event in which the agent start work on exercise~\ref{mfp:g}.

  Is it the case that the agent is concluding \pv{\propI{a is 6}}{\valI{True}} from \pv{\propI{\(2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}\)}}{\valI{True}}.

  Whether this holds.

  Two issues.

  First.

  Agent is \(\pv{n\propI{ is }200}{\valI{True}}\), but \pv{\propI{a is 6}}{\valI{True}} may be a little more difficult.
  \ref{mfp:f} is straightforward pattern matching, while \ref{mfp:g} requires some insight.
  Still, it may be true.
  Questions chosen well, then insight is required.
  Reasoning with an understanding of the rule, rather than reasoning with the rule.
  Still, \ref{mfp:a} or \ref{mfp:d}.

  Second.

  Whether it need be the case that the progressive is true.
  Stronger than stating that there is an event.
  But, understanding, then no failure.

\subsection[Dispositions]{Dispositions \hfill (Optional)}
\label{sec:dispositions}

\begin{note}
  In this optional section we clarify \autoref{idea:tR-law} by applying the same to dispositions.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Consider the `\dBCA{0}' of dispositions:%

  \begin{sketch}[\dBCA{2}]
    \label{sketch:dBCA}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Object \(o\) has disposition \(d\)
    \end{itemize}
    \emph{If and only if}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There are descriptors \(C\)(ondition) and \(M\)(anifestation) such that:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \emph{If} it were the case that \(C\), \emph{then} \(o\) would \(M\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{sketch}

  \noindent%
  The \dBCA{0} is common.
  For example, consider the following passages:

  \begin{quote}
    To say that an object \(a\) is (water-) \emph{soluble} at time \(t\) is to say that if \(a\) were in water at \(t\), \(a\) would dissolve at \(t\).%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[203]{Quine:2013aa})}
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
    Dispositional words like `know', `believe', `aspire', `clever' and `humorous' are determinable dispositional words.
    They signify abilities, tendencies or pronenesses to do, not things of one unique kind, but things of lots of different kinds.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[118]{Ryle:1949aa})}
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
    [A] statement like

    \(w\) is inflammable

    amounts to [\dots] some such fainthearted counterfactual as

    If all conditions had been propitious and \(w\) had been heated enough, it would have burned.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[39]{Goodman:1983aa})}
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The \dBCA{0} entails a statement of the same form as \autoref{idea:tR-law}:

  \begin{proposition}[Basic proposition]
    \label{obs:disp:basic}
    The \dBCA{0} entails:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Object \(o\) has disposition \(d\)
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{Only if}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There are descriptors \(C'\) and \(M'\) such that:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        For every \scen{0}:
        \emph{If} \(C'\) is the case, \emph{then} \(o\) manifests \(M'\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{obs:disp:basic}
    Suppose the \dBCA{0} holds and condition some object \(o\) with disposition \(d\).
    Given the \dBCA{0}, there are descriptors \(C\) and \(M\) such that:
    \emph{If} it were the case that \(C\), \emph{then} \(o\) would \(M\).

    Consider the \scen{1} where \(C\) are the case, and what \(M\) captures.
    Now, re-express \(C\) as \(C'\) and \(M\) as \(M'\) such that \(C'\) and \(M'\) do not depend on context (esp.\ world) of evaluation.
  \end{argument}

  Note, however, \autoref{obs:disp:basic} is a \emph{only if} statement.
  It need not be the case that \(C'\) captures all conditions.

  Ambiguity of the \dBCA{}.
  It is not clear whether the same \(C\) and \(M\) apply to all \scen{1} where the object has the disposition, or whether \(C\) and \(M\) may vary.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Parallel between the \dBCA{} and \autoref{idea:tR-law}.

  With this in hand, briefly observe a number of issues for the \emph{simple} conditional analysis of dispositions do not apply to the \dBCA{}.
  And, hence, similar issues do not extend to \autoref{idea:tR-law}.

  The simple conditional analysis is as follows:%
  \footnote{
    Compare to, e.g. \citeauthor{Lewis:1997wg}'s account:
    \textquote{%
      Something \(x\) is disposed at time \(t\) to give response \(r\) to stimulus \(s\) iff, if \(x\) were to undergo stimulus \(s\) at time \(t\), \(x\) would give response \(r\).%
    }
    (\citeyear[143]{Lewis:1997wg})
  }

  \begin{sketch}[The simple conditional analysis, cf.\ \cite[\S1.2]{Choi:2021wg}]%
    An object \(o\) disposed to \(M\) when \(C\) \emph{iff} \(o\) would \(M\) if it were the case that \(C\).
  \end{sketch}

  Observe, \(C\) and \(M\) are used to characterise the disposition, and therefore the choice of \(C\) and \(M\) in the analysis is fixed.

  Counterexamples to the the simple conditional analysis require this equivalence.
  To \illu{0}, we consider masks and revise-finks:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Masks

    (\cite{Johnston:1992aa})
    Fragile.
    Break when dropped.
    Applies to the ornament.
    However, wrapped in protective packaging.
    No option to exclude the protective packaging, and \(C\) does not exclude.
  \item
    (Reverse) finks.
    (\cite{Martin:1994aa})

    Wire is disposed to conduct electricity when touched by a live wire.
    Wire is a platinum wire.
    Reverse fink, when touched, changes the platinum wire into a plastic wire.
  \end{itemize}

  For the basic conditional analysis, no restriction.%
  \footnote{
    Examples of basic conditional analysis are those cited by \citeauthor{Choi:2021wg} as endorsements of simple conditional analysis.
    This is clearly not the case.

    Though, it's hard to say whether \citeauthor{Choi:2021wg} are at fault.
    For, \citeauthor{Choi:2021wg}'s initial discussion of the simple conditional analysis is almost identical to that of~(\cite[60]{Manley:2008aa}).
    Though, in turn \citeauthor{Manley:2008aa}'s discussion is almost identical to~(\cite[\S2.1]{Fara:2006aa})\dots

    Anyway, \citeauthor{Choi:2021wg} distinguish the simple conditional analysis from `Entailment':
    \begin{quote}
      \emph{F} is a disposition iff there are an associated stimulus condition and manifestation such that, necessarily, \emph{x} has \emph{F} only if \emph{x} would produce the manifestation if it were in the stimulus condition.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[\S2.1]{Choi:2021wg})}
    \end{quote}
    And, `Entailment' is equivalent to the basic conditional analysis.
    However, \citeauthor{Choi:2021wg} add:
    \begin{quote}
      If disposition ascriptions do not entail corresponding counterfactual conditionals, then Entailment is hopeless.
      Note that the apparent counterexamples to [the simple conditional analysis] may seem to show just that.
      But let's leave this claim aside for the sake of argument.
    \end{quote}
    There is nothing to set aside here.
  }

  Unless wrapped, is not connected to a reverse-fink.
  At best, masks and finks highlight difficulties with specifying \(C\) and \(M\).%
  \footnote{
    As \citeauthor{Bonevac:2011tz} stress:
    \begin{quote}
      Counterexamples must be deployed as counterexamples to specific proposals.
      The example of a glass packed in styrofoam can perhaps show that fragile cannot be analysed as would break if struck, but it shows nothing about a proposed analysis of fragile as would break if struck when unwrapped, and certainly shows nothing about any proposed analysis of a different dispositional term, such as irascible.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[1144]{Bonevac:2011tz})}
    \end{quote}

    \nocite{Manley:2007aa}
    In response~\cite{Manley:2011aa} (\citeyear{Manley:2011aa}) argue that counterexamples concern whether it is possible for \autoref{obs:disp:basic} to function as an analysis of disposition ascriptions --- not whether \autoref{obs:disp:basic} is true.
    (See in particular (\citeyear[\S1.3]{Manley:2011aa}))
  }

  This is well understood, and predates masks and finks.

  \citeauthor{Goodman:1983aa}

  \begin{quote}
    [W]e can define ``flexible'' if we find an auxiliary manifest predicate that is suitably related to ``flexes'' through `causal' principles or laws.
    The problem of dispositions is to define the nature of the connection involved here:
    the problem of characterizing a relation such that if the initial manifest predicate ``Q'' stands in this relation to another manifest predicate or conjunction of manifest predicates ``A'', then ``A'' may be equated with the dispositional counterpart---``Q-able'' or ``Q\textsc{d}''---of the predicate ``Q''.\newline
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[45]{Goodman:1983aa} --- first published in 1955)}
  \end{quote}

  In this respect, accounts of dispositions that extend simple conditional analysis are just instances of the basic conditional analysis, extended.%
  \footnote{
    Does not need to be the case.

    \citeauthor{Lewis:1997wg}'s (\citeyear{Lewis:1997wg}) appeal to intrinsic properties specifies additional component of the relevant circumstances.

    See (\cite[\S1.4]{Choi:2021wg}) for additional examples.

  \begin{observation}
    \label{obs:disp:partial}
    Given \autoref{obs:disp:basic},

    Partial grasp on conditions under which disposition manifests (i.e. \(C'\) and \(M'\)) is sufficient to establish an object does not have disposition \(d\).
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{obs:disp:partial}
    Sufficient for `law' on which disposition depends is false.
    As law is universally quantified conditional, an instance where circumstances obtains but the disposition does not manifest.
  \end{motivation}

  For example, drop, doesn't break.
  Well, it's not fragile.

  It is this aspect of lawfulness that's of interest.
  Event \(e\) and the agent is not concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).

  \autoref{idea:tR-law} is neutral.
  Event from some collection.
  This is necessary.
  For, an agent is not reasoning unless an event is taking place.
  Difficulty is characterising collection.
  Though, this is not something we have any interest in doing.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The parallels between \autoref{idea:tR-law} and dispositions does not suggest that for an agent to be \dtC{} is for the agent to have a disposition.
  At least, no more than a calculator is disposed to display \(345\) after \(23 \cdot 15\) and a button marked `\(=\)' is pressed.%

\section{\tC{2}}
\label{cha:typical:tCDef}

\begin{note}
  \dtC{}, \autoref{idea:tR-law} (\autopageref{idea:tR-law}), depend on law.

  We now turn to \tC{}, where the hyphen signifies a technical term.
  \tC{} designed for a specific purpose, and therefore narrow.
  Key thing is to obtain explicit link between \tC{} and \fc{1}.

  Role of \tC{} is to motivate counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.

  Three definitions.
\end{note}

\subsection{\torN{3}}
\label{cha:typical:tCDef:ToRdef}

\begin{note}
  \tocN{3} are defined in terms of propositions, values, and \pool{1}:

  \begin{definition}[\tocN{2}]
    \label{def:tor}
    \mbox{ }
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(T\) is a \emph{\tocN{0}}.
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(T\) is a collection of proposition-value-\pool{} pairings.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  Intuitively, think of a \tocN{} (as defined) as the \emph{extension} of a \tocN{}.
  No assumptions about reasoning.
  However, conclusions.
  Proposition-value pairs and \pool{1}.
  Interest is with conclusions, so narrow.%
  \footnote{
    Not events, as it may be the case that agent's reasoning is of type, even though there is no event in which the agent reasons.
    Reasoning, progressive.
    Need not be the case that agent reasons.

    For example, language comprehension.
    Novel sentences, even those which are never produced.
  }

  This is difficult.
  However, interest is not with any particular type.
  Only whether reasoning is of some type.

  As will be seen, types are flexible.
  Type of reasoning in general, type of reasoning for an agent, type of reasoning for an agent given particular circumstances, and so on.

  Further, necessary condition for \tC{}.
  This extensional approach is sufficient.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  To \illu{1} with the basic case of modus ponens:

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      \multicolumn{2}{c}{\prop{2}-\val{}-\pool{} pairings in type `by modus ponens'} \\
      \hline\hline
      Proposition-value pair & \pool{2} \\
      \hline
      \pv{Q}{\valI{True}} & \pv{P}{\valI{True}}, \pv{\propI{If }P\propI{ then }Q}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  Where, \(P\), \(Q\).
  Likewise, in the following \(R\) are descriptions.

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      \multicolumn{2}{c}{\prop{2}-\val{}-\pool{} pairings not in type `by modus ponens'} \\

      Proposition-value pair & \pool{2} \\
      \hline
      \pv{R}{\valI{True}} & \pv{P}{\valI{True}}, \pv{\propI{If }P\propI{ or }Q\propI{ then }R}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \pv{Q}{\valI{False}} & \pv{P}{\valI{True}}, \pv{\propI{If }P\propI{ then }Q}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  Difficulty.
  As extension, no way to distinguish between two \tocN{1} with the same extension.

  For example, modus ponens and hypothetical syllogism.

  However, our goal is a necessary condition.
  In line with idea, failure.
  So, if some circumstance, then neither modus ponens nor hypothetical syllogism.%
  \footnote{
    May distinguish between `quss' and `plus'. (\cite{Kripke:1982aa}.)
    However, to the extent this is justification, no interest.

    I think type is primarily descriptive.
    However, necessary.
    Therefore, no principled objection to individuating types by whether the agent is justified.
  }

  For example, means-end reasoning.
  Some goal, reasons to an action.
  \pool{3} contains proposition-value pair which captures the goal, and proposition-value pair captures action.

  \ptC{2}, simple law.

  Key is specification of conditions.

  Though, ensure that we have enough from the actual to ensure truth of progressive.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The broad idea.

  If reasoning is of type \(T\), then, if the agent has the opportunity to reason from some premises associated with the type, then the agent may reason from the premises by the type of reasoning.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Limitation.

  Failure does not establish not of type.%
  \footnote{
    Point is similar to \citeauthor{Chomsky:2015aa}'s distinction between competence and performance.

    \begin{quote}
    Arithmetical competence yields the correct number z for every pair~(x,~y) under addition or multiplication.
    But only a small finite subpart of arithmetical competence can be exhibited without external aids (by calculating in one's head).
    Obviously, that fact does not imply that arithmetical competence is correspondingly limited.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[xii]{Chomsky:2015aa})}
  \end{quote}

    \citeauthor{Chomsky:2015aa} also motivates distinction by errors (\citeyear[2]{Chomsky:2015aa}).
    Unclear how errors relate to progressive.
    Present problems are sufficient, so we ignore.
  }

  For example, illustration.
  Here,~\ref{mfp:b},~\ref{mfp:d}, and~\ref{mfp:e} all involve fractions.
  However, agent is shaky on fractions.
  Rule of multiplication is good, but not with fractions.

  Issue is perhaps with the type.
  Perhaps~\ref{mfp:b},~\ref{mfp:d}, and~\ref{mfp:e} should not correspond to members of relevant type.

  However, with some imagination, available action that leads to difficulties.
  For example, \(2^{43 \cdot 54} \cdot 2^{53!}\).
  Agent needs not more than multiplication and addition, but progressive fails.
  Difficulty of solving multiplication in order to sum.
  And, perhaps, temptation to get a calculator.

  Still, reasoning by type in problems the agent does solve.

  For example, \autoref{illu:tR:powers}.

  \tocN{}, particular collection.

  Here, clearly not sufficient.
  Various ways to get a handful of answers.


  Likewise, selection task.

  Here's the answer.

  In general, require more.

\begin{note}
  The converse conditional is also interesting.
  Type \(T'\) is sufficient for type \(T\).
  However, the difficulty with this suggestion is whether the conditional.

\begin{note}
  Slight issue, single instances is sufficient for failure.
  In this case, set \(T'\) to be \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\), and consider a parallel definition which requires failure of progressive to hold for some threshold of \tI{}.

  In part, appeal of \autoref{def:tC} is that necessary condition identified requires non-empty \tRep{} to do any work.
  At issue is whether \autoref{idea:tR-law} holds.
  Whether there is a `lawful' connexion between reasoning of type and other circumstances.

  For, doesn't clearly follow that needs to be the case the agent translates each chapter title.

% \nocite{Black:1951aa}

% \begin{note}
%   The point here is that with Carroll, generality that goes beyond any single instance.
%   Must apply to all instances, to be valid.
%   But, cannot hope to cover all instances in a single move.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   A difficulty found on a reading of \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj}'s \citetitle{Carroll:1895uj}.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   \begin{quote}
%     ``Plenty of blank leaves, I see!'' the Tortoise cheerily remarked.
%     ``We shall need them \emph{all}!''
%     (Achilles shuddered.)
%     ``Now write as I dictate:---

%     \begin{enumerate}[label=(\emph{\Alph*}), ref=\emph{\Alph*}]
%     \item
%       \label{AatT:a}
%       Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other.
%     \item
%       \label{AatT:b}
%       The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the same.
%     \item
%       \label{AatT:c}
%       If~\ref{AatT:a} and~\ref{AatT:b} are true,~\ref{AatT:z} must be true.
%       \setcounter{enumi}{25}
%     \item
%       \label{AatT:z}
%       The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other.''
%     \end{enumerate}

%     ``You should call it~\ref{AatT:d}, not~\ref{AatT:z},'' said Achilles.
%     ``It comes \emph{next} to the other three.
%     If you accept~\ref{AatT:a} and~\ref{AatT:b} and~\ref{AatT:c}, you \emph{must} accept~\ref{AatT:z}.''

%     ``And why \emph{must} I?''

%     ``Because it follows \emph{logically} from them.
%     If~\ref{AatT:a} and~\ref{AatT:b} and~\ref{AatT:c} are true,~\ref{AatT:z} \emph{must} be true.
%     You don't dispute \emph{that}, I imagine?''

%     ``If~\ref{AatT:a} and~\ref{AatT:b} and~\ref{AatT:c} are true,~\ref{AatT:z} \emph{must} be true,'' the Tortoise thoughtfully repeated.
%     ``That's \emph{another} Hypothetical, isn't it?
%     And, if I failed to see its truth, I might accept~\ref{AatT:a} and~\ref{AatT:b} and~\ref{AatT:c}, and \emph{still} not accept~\ref{AatT:z}, mightn't I ?''

%     \mbox{}\hfill\(\vdots\)\hfill\mbox{}

%     ``Then Logic would take you by the throat, and force you to do it!''
%     Achilles triumphantly replied.
%     ``Logic would tell you 'You ca'n't help yourself.''%
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[279--280]{Carroll:1895uj})}
%   \end{quote}

%   The Tortoise has written down three premises,~\ref{AatT:a},~\ref{AatT:b}, and~\ref{AatT:c}.
%   Achilles holds that~\ref{AatT:z} follows from~\ref{AatT:a},~\ref{AatT:b}, and~\ref{AatT:c}.
%   The Tortoise observes they have the possibility of refraining to accept~\ref{AatT:z} follows from~\ref{AatT:a},~\ref{AatT:b}, and~\ref{AatT:c}.
%   And (initially), the Tortoise does not accept~\ref{AatT:z} follows from~\ref{AatT:a},~\ref{AatT:b}, and~\ref{AatT:c}.
%   Achilles requests the Tortoise accepts that~\ref{AatT:z} follows from~\ref{AatT:a},~\ref{AatT:b}, and~\ref{AatT:c}, and the Tortoise complies.
%   Specifically, the Tortoise grants:

%   \begin{quote}
%     \begin{enumerate}[label=(\emph{\Alph*}), ref=\emph{\Alph*}]
%       \setcounter{enumi}{3}
%     \item

%       If~\ref{AatT:a} and~\ref{AatT:b} and~\ref{AatT:c} are true,~\ref{AatT:z} must be true.%
%       \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[279]{Carroll:1895uj})}
%     \end{enumerate}
%   \end{quote}

%   But, does not accept~\ref{AatT:z} follows from~\ref{AatT:a},~\ref{AatT:b},~\ref{AatT:c}, and~\ref{AatT:d}.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   Modus ponens.

%   \begin{quote}
%     From \(\phi\) and \emph{if} \(\phi\) then \(\psi\), infer \(\psi\).
%   \end{quote}

%   Modus ponens is general.
%   For \emph{any} \(\phi\), \(\psi\).

%   Now, there is a difference between \emph{modus ponens} and conditional.

%   However, take any instance.
%   Then, if \(P\), \(P \rightarrow Q\), \(Q\) must be true.
%   But, then this means that the conditional is true.

%   Consequence of the deduction theorem.

%   Likewise, deduction theorem goes the other way.

%   However, going from \(P\), \(P \rightarrow Q\) to \(Q\) need not be an instance of \emph{modus ponens}.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   Well, this is a headache.
%   \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} is talking about a specific A, B, and Z.
%   There is no clear generality.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   So, consider at issue is modus ponens.
%   For any specific instance accept, there is a further instance.
%   For, \(A, (A \rightarrow B) \vDash B\).
%   Then, \(\vDash (A \land (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B)\).
%   However, now, \(A \land (A \rightarrow B), (A \land (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B) \vDash B\).
%   And, so on.

%   The general pattern, get conditional, but then this gives a new instance of modus ponens, which must be true in order for modus ponens to be valid rule of inference.

%   \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj}, by contrast, starts with \(A \vDash B\).
%   This is different.
%   However, rather than focusing on a single rule of inference, the puzzle turns on what validity amounts to.

%   Validity is a general thing, with specific instances.
%   However, grant any particular instance of validity without employing validity in general.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   \begin{quote}
%     My paradox \dots turns on the fact that, in a Hypothetical, the \emph{truth} of the Protasis, the \emph{truth} of the Apodosis, and the \emph{validity of the sequence}, are 3 distinct Propositions.

%     \mbox{}\hfill\(\vdots\)\hfill\mbox{}

%     Suppose I say ``I grant~\ref{AatT:a} and~\ref{AatT:b} and~\ref{AatT:c}, but I do \emph{not} grant that I am thereby \emph{obliged} to grant~\ref{AatT:z}.''
%     Surely, my granting~\ref{AatT:z} must \emph{wait} until I have been made to see the validity of this sequence: i.e.\ in order to grant~\ref{AatT:z}, I must grant~\ref{AatT:a},~\ref{AatT:b},~\ref{AatT:c}, and~\ref{AatT:d}! And so on.%
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[472]{Carroll:1977wl})}
%   \end{quote}

%   My interpretation of the point \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} makes in this passage is that the truth of A B and the truth of C is distinct from the validity of A B C.
%   Granting is substantial, not merely moving.
%   But, in order to grant, this means granting all other cases.

%   So, the paradox is that, on the one hand, don't need validity for any specific true things.
%   But, on the other hand, only of interest if via validity.

%   The Tortoise is slowly working through each instance, but this has no hope of getting the Tortoise to general validity.
%   So, how does the Tortoise ever make it there?
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   This point differs from received interpretation.

%   \citeauthor{Wieland:2013vf} (\citeyear{Wieland:2013vf}) characterises the general understanding of \textcite{Carroll:1895uj} in terms of two lessons:
%   \begin{quote}
%     [T]he negative lesson is that if you add ever more premises to an argument \dots, then you will never demonstrate that its conclusion follows logically.\newline
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[984]{Wieland:2013vf})}
%   \end{quote}

%   Parallel, static answers, still option for concluding otherwise.

%   \begin{quote}
%     [T]he positive lesson is that rules of inference, rather than premises of the form `if premises such and such are true, then the conclusion is true', will do the job.\newline
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[984]{Wieland:2013vf})}
%   \end{quote}

%   \begin{quote}
%     [\citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj}] simply lacked any distinct conception of a deduction as opposed to the assertion (``granting'' of) a hypothetical proposition.
%     \dots
%     Any attempt by Carroll to tackle the question of inference was bound to begin in confusion and end in constipation-all those premises piling up, but no motion.
%   \end{quote}
% \end{note}

% \paragraph{The Dichotomy}

% \begin{note}
%   Achilles and the Tortoise, Zeno's argument.

%   Surely, right?

%   Two ways to understand.
%   Does the Tortoise move at all, or does the Tortoise arrive at the end?
%   I mean, as formulated by Zeno, it's about catching up, no matter how much one moves.

%   It is different from Zeno's Dichotomy paradox.


%   If so, then we should expect the Tortoise to be making some movement.
%   Adding rules of inference is of no help, because the problem is not movement, it's about how to move so much in a single step.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   \color{red}
%   Something about logic forcing.
%   The Tortoise hasn't arrived.

%   Nothing hangs on validity.
%   Same issue with testimony.
%   `A'.
%   Why?
%   Testified A, so A.
%   Okay, but another instance of testimony.
%   Testified(Testified A, so A), so Testified A, so A.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   \begin{quote}
%     But if we who wish to represent his belief in Q as based on P are to write in our notebook everything his having that belief on that basis consists in then when we have written only P and Q we will not have written enough.
%     Someone can believe P and believe Q and still not believe Q on the basis of P whatever the relations between the propositions P and Q happen to be.
%     He might believe Q for some reason completely unconnected with P, or perhaps for no reason at all (if that is possible).%
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[185]{Stroud:1979aa})}
%   \end{quote}
%   However, the moral drawn is narrow
%   \begin{quote}
%     The moral is that for every proposition or set of propositions the belief or acceptance of which is involved in someone's believing one proposition on the basis of another there must be something else, not simply a further proposition accepted, that is responsible for the one belief's being based on the other.%
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[187]{Stroud:1979aa})}
%   \end{quote}

%   Even if we grant each individual is \ros{}, rather than an instance of the material conditional, \emph{logic} hasn't done anything.
% \end{note}

% \paragraph{General and specific: Contrast}

% \begin{note}
%   Use \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} to illustrate this point.

%   However, given the worry, various other things may be understood this way.

%   Hume, constant conjunction.
%   Part of the problem is identifying cause.
%   We get the famous line about observing.
%   However, Hume goes on.
%   It's not only no observation, but no generality.

%   Right, so more narrow than Hume.
%   Because, with Hume, at issue is whether we have grounds for this general thing.
%   With Carroll, it's whether we even really get to the general thing.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   \begin{quote}
%     Let me ask this: what has the expression of a rule—say a sign-post—got to do with my actions?
%     What sort of connexion is there here?%
%     ---%
%     Well, perhaps this one:
%     I have been trained to react to this sign in a particular way, and now I do so react to it.

%     But that is only to give a causal connexion; to tell how it has come about that we now go by the sign-post; not what this going-by-the sign really consists in.
%     On the contrary; I have further indicated that a person goes by a sign-post only in so far as there exists a regular use of sign-posts, a custom.%
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[\S198]{Wittgenstein:1958aa})}

% \subsection{Types and explanation}
% \label{cha:typical:sec:tor:bkgd}

% \begin{note}
%   There is a related, stronger claim, that generality derives from rule following.

%   For this, \citeauthor{Boghossian:2008vf}:

%   \begin{quote}
%     [O]ur internalization of general epistemic rules---like Modus Ponens and Induction---explain and rationalize why we form the beliefs that we form.
%     And that seems intuitively correct.

%     As in the case of our linguistic and conceptual abilities, our ability to form rational beliefs is \emph{productive}: on the basis of finite learning, we are able to form rational beliefs under a potential infinity of novel circumstances.
%     The only plausible explanation for this is that we have, somehow, internalized a rule that tells us, in some general way, what it would be rational to believe under varying epistemic circumstances.%
%     \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[483]{Boghossian:2008vf})}
%   \end{quote}

%   Strictly, \citeauthor{Boghossian:2008vf}, rules \textquote{represent our conception of how it would be most rational for a thinker to form beliefs under different epistemic circumstances} (\citeyear[473]{Boghossian:2008vf}).

%   The difference in approach is clearest with \citeauthor{Boghossian:2008vf}'s account of modus ponens:%
%   \footnote{
%     \citeauthor{Boghossian:2008vf} notes the rule is distinct from modus pones as found in textbooks.
%     Remarks: \textquote{It is actually quite mysterious what the logic textbook rule is supposed to be} (\citeyear[472,fn.2]{Boghossian:2008vf})

% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   Likewise, means-end reasoning is distinct from \citeauthor{Broome:2013aa}'s

%   \emph{S} is some source, such as morality.
%   \emph{N} is a person. (\citeyear[117]{Broome:2013aa})

%   Instead, the significantly weaker idea that the agent has reasoned from some end to a means to that end.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   On my understanding, this is, in part, the role of \citeauthor{Boghossian:2014aa}'s Taking Condition.

%       First, write out expected utility for each situation.

%       \hfill\mbox{ }
%       \smallskip

%       Suppose Situation A is preferred to Situation B.
%       Hence, \(\EU{Sit.\ A} > \EU{Sit.\ B}\).
%       Expanding, we obtain:
%       %
%       \[
%         \Util{100\text{m}} > .10 \cdot \Util{500\text{m}} + .89 \cdot \Util{100\text{m}} + .1 \cdot \Util{0\text{m}}
%       \]

%       Now, consider subtracting \(.89 \cdot \Util{100\text{m}}\) from each side of the inequality and adding \(.89 \cdot \Util{0\text{m}}\):
%       %
%       \begin{align*}
%         \Util{100\text{m}} - .89 \cdot \Util{100\text{m}} &> .10 \cdot \Util{500\text{m}} + .01 \cdot \Util{0\text{m}} \\
%          .11 \cdot \Util{100\text{m}} + .89 \cdot \Util{0\text{m}} &> .10 \cdot \Util{500\text{m}} + .90 \cdot \Util{0\text{m}}
%       \end{align*}

%       The left and right side of the inequality are \EU{Sit.\ C} and \EU{Sit.\ D}, respectively.
%       Therefore, it should be the case that Situation C is preferred to Situation D.

%   \end{quote}
%   However, this is not the case.
%   \citeauthor{Allais:1979aa} highlights pattern to the contrary:
%   \textquote{\emph{[T]he pattern for most highly prudent persons [\dots] who are considered generally as rational, is the pairing \(\text{A} > \text{B}\) and \(\text{C} < \text{D}\).}}
%   (\citeyear[89]{Allais:1979aa})

%   So, we have a something lawlike.%

%   Two things here.
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     Entailment between preferences.
%   \item
%     Circumstance in which conflicting preferences.
%   \end{itemize}

%   Both work, but the latter is of interest.%
