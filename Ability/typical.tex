\begin{note}
  This chapter develops of feature of the intuitive idea of an agent concluding some \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{} by some \emph{type} of reasoning --- colloquially, we say the agent is \emph{\typeAdj{}} concluding the \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{}.

  Intuitively, an agent is \typeAdj{} concluding just in case there is some generality to the agent's reasoning which concluding.%
  \footnote{
    See \autoref{assu:ConRea} (\autopageref{assu:ConRea}) for more on the assumption that an agent is reasoning when concluding.
  }
  For example, the agent is reasoning by modus ponens, arithmetic, or the categorical imperative, etc.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  The feature of interest is what we term the `\tpro{}' of a type of reasoning.
  Roughly, if an agent is \tCV{} by some \torN{} then in certain circumstances the agent reasons in a particular way.

  This feature is perhaps easiest to observe in the context of negative results about types of reasoning.
  For example, \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} (\citeyear{Wason:1966aa}) argued the failure of agents to complete selection tasks in a particular way showed agents do reason about natural language conditions as material conditionals.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  The role of a \tprof{0} in the overall argument is to provide sufficient conditions for a \requ{}.
  The first section of this chapter introduces the idea of a \tprof{0}, and the second section uses the idea of a \tpro{0} to link an agent \tCN{} to \fc{1}.
  In turn, \autoref{sec:typicalRequs} builds on the second section to provide sufficient conditions for a \requ{}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  At the close of the chapter all the idea relating to counterexamples to \issueInclusion{} will have been stated.

\section{\tprof{3}}
\label{cha:typical:int}






\subsection{\torN{3}}
\label{cha:typical:tCDef:ToRdef}


\begin{note}
  Our overall interest is agent is concluding.
  A conclusion is often the result reasoning.
  And, some instances of reasoning are, intuitively, of a type.
  For example, \(T\) in the schema `type of reasoning \(T\)' may be substituted with `modus ponens', `means-end reasoning', `arithmetic', `consequentialism', and so on.

  We define a \torN{0} extensionally via \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings:

  \begin{definition}[A \torN{0}]
    \label{def:tor}
    \mbox{ }
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(T\) is a \torN{}.
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(T\) is a collection of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  \autoref{def:tor} is motivated by the minimal assumptions we have made about conclusions.

  First, observe we have assumed a conclusion is an \eval{} that some \prop{0} has some \val{0} from some \pool{0} and nothing more.
  Hence, for any reasoning associated with a conclusion there is always some \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings associated with the reasoning.
  And so for any \emph{intuitive} \torN{} there will always be an associate \torN{} as defined.

  Second, observe we have made no other assumptions about what a conclusion amounts to.
  So, without introducing further assumptions we have no way of provide an account of a \torN{0} in any finer-grain.%
  \footnote{
    Note, it need not be the case that the agent is following a rule as advocated for by, e.g.\ \textcite{Boghossian:2008vf,Boghossian:2012vb} and \textcite{Broome:2002aa,Broome:2013aa}.
    Though, a \torNa{} may be understood as the extension of some rule.
  }
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Of course, this extensional definition of a \torN{0} is not ideal.

  For example, I offer no guarantee there will be an extensional difference in terms of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings given two \torN{1} which are (intuitively) intensionally distinct.
  And, for any collection of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings amounts to a \torN{0}.

  Still, a more ideal definition of a \torN{0} may be substituted in place of \autoref{def:tor} so long as the definition returns a collection of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  For a brief example of a \torN{}, consider factorisation (as in~\autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}).

  The following \prop{2}-\val{}-\pool{} pairings are plausibly in the type `factorisation', where the ellipses are expanded to include \prop{0}-\val{0} pairs which capture the \agents{} understanding of factorisation:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      \pv{\rootsCon{}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \pv{\propM{x \in \{4,2\}}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{x^{2} - 4x + 8 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \pv{\propM{x \in \{70,-2\}}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{x^{2} - 68x - 140 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  %
  Likewise, the following \prop{2}-\val{}-\pool{} pairings are plausibly \emph{not} in the type `factorisation', where the ellipses may be expanded arbitrarily:

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      \pv{\rootsConBad{}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \pv{\propI{n is 2000}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{4^{100} = 2^{n}}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \pv{\propM{x \in \{70,-2\}}}{\valI{Want}} & \pv{\propM{x^{2} - 68x - 140 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  \noindent%
  For, the first \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairing is not the case, the second pairing is unrelated to factorisation, and the third pairing concerns a desire, rather than what is.
\end{note}



\subsection{\tprof{3}}
\label{sec:tpros}


\begin{note}
  With the definition of a \torN{0} in hand we definition the feature of an agent \tCV{} of interest.
  We term this  the \emph{\tpro{}} of a \torN{}:

  \begin{definition}[The \tprof{0}]
    \label{def:tpro}
    For a collection \(\mathcal{P}\) of events associated with \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\mathcal{P}\) is a projection of a type \(T\) with respect to \(\ed{}\) \vAgent{}.
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}:

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is \emph{\tCV{}} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by type \(T\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      For every event \(\edn{\ast}\) and associated \prop{0}-\val{} pair \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \pool{0} \(\Psi\) in \(\mathcal{P}\):
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is in \(T\).
      \item
        \(\edn{\ast}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  Intuitively, \autoref{def:tpro} expresses the idea that an agent is \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by type of reasoning \(T\) only if some `law' holds.
  Where, `law' is understood in the colloquial sense of a universally quantified material conditional.%
  \footnote{
    For example, consider \citeauthor{Helmholtz:1977aa}'s characterisation of laws of nature:%
    \begin{quote}
      \nocite{Wilson:2006aa}
      Every law of nature asserts that upon preconditions alike in a certain respect, there always follow consequences that are alike in a certain other respect.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[122]{Helmholtz:1977aa})}
    \end{quote}
    %
    Or the law of large numbers:
    %
    \begin{quote}
      Things of every kind of nature are subject to a universal law which one may well call \emph{the Law of Large Numbers}.
      It consists in that if one observes large numbers of events of the same nature [\dots] one finds that the proportions of occurrence are almost constant [\dots]\newline
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor{Seneta:2013aa}'s (\citeyear[9--10]{Seneta:2013aa}) translation of (\cite[7]{Poisson:1837aa}))}
    \end{quote}
    %
    And \citeauthor{Hempel:1965aa}'s Deductive-Nomological account of scientific explanation, \citeauthor{Boole:1854aa}'s laws of thought, etc.
  }
  Or, as stating the agent is disposed to conclude in a certain way.
  For additional notes on this suggestion, see \autoref{cha:tc2-dispositions} (\autopageref{cha:tc2-dispositions}).%
  \footnote{
    Alternatively, a \tpro{} may be through to capture the modal robustness of an agent \tCV{}.
    In line with, for example, sensitivity (\cite{Nozick:1981aa}) and safety (\cite{Sosa:1999aa}) conditions on knowledge.
    Or, the intuition that a skilfully made paper aeroplane flies in a variety of conditions, etc.
  }

  This is perhaps easier to see by rearranging \autoref{def:tpro}:

  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:tpro-switch}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      Conditions \ref{prop:tpro-switch:a} and \ref{prop:tpro-switch:b} hold:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        \label{prop:tpro-switch:a}
        \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \item
        \label{prop:tpro-switch:b}
        \(\mathcal{P}\) is a projection of a type \(T\) with respect to \(\ed{}\) \vAgent{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      For every event \(\edn{\sharp}\) and associated \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pair \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) in \(\mathcal{P}\):
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \(\edn{\sharp}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:tpro-switch}
    Immediate.
  \end{argument}

  \noindent%
  Note, in particular, it is not possible to strengthen \autoref{prop:tpro-switch} to a biconditional as \tpro{1} are only defined in terms of a necessary condition on an agent \tCV{}.
\end{note}



\subsection{\illu{3}}
\label{sec:illu3-1}

\begin{note}
  We give two \illu{1} of \autoref{def:tpro}.

  The first \illu{0} considers selection tasks, and more broadly links \tprof{1} to negative results concerning reasoning found in the literature.

  The second \illu{0} considers multiplication by powers, and highlights our interest with a \tprof{}.
\end{note}



\paragraph*{Selection tasks}
\nocite{Wason:1968aa}
\nocite{Wason:1971aa}
\label{par:selection-tasks}


\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} details their initial section task as follows:
  %
  \begin{quote}
    The subjects (students) were presented with an array of cards and told that every card had a letter on one side and a number on the other side, and that either would be face upwards.
    They were then instructed to decide which cards they would need to turn over in order to determine whether the experimenter was lying in uttering the following statement:
    \emph{if a card has a vowel on one side then it has an even number on the other side}.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[145--146]{Wason:1966aa})}
  \end{quote}
  %
  \autoref{fig:sectionTask} is an example task.
  %
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      cardnode/.style={
        rectangle,
        minimum width=10mm,
        minimum height=14mm,
        align=center,
        rounded corners,
        font = {\Large\sffamily},
        very thick,
      },
      node distance=5mm,
      ]

      \node[cardnode, draw] (1) {2};
      \node[cardnode, draw, right = of 1] (2) {N};
      \node[cardnode, draw, right = of 2] (3) {E};
      \node[cardnode, draw, right = of 3] (4) {1};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A selection task}
    \label{fig:sectionTask}
  \end{figure}

  \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} observes the results are consistent with the following hypothesis:%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} does not provide a detailed summary of the results.
    However, \citeauthor{Johnson-Laird:1969aa} detail results of \emph{twenty four} University College London students!
    Specifically, 19 of the 24 responded as excepted given \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}'s hypothesis.
    (\citeyear[369--370]{Johnson-Laird:1969aa}).
  }
  \begin{quote}
    Subjects assume implicitly that a conditional statement has, not two truth values, but three: true, false and `irrelevant'.
    Vowels with even numbers verify, vowels with odd numbers falsify and consonants with any number are irrelevant.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[146]{Wason:1966aa})}
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Selection tasks may be understood in connexion with \autoref{def:tpro}.
  For example:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The relevant \tocN{} \(T\) is `reasoning via the material conditional'.%
    \footnote{
      \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}'s hypothesis concerns a conditional statement having two truth values, but does not specify what these values are.
      Still, it is clear by \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}'s discussion these capture the material conditional.
    }
  \item
    The relevant \tpro{} \(\mathcal{P}\) consists of events in which an agent is doing a selection task with an associated \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings which capture appropriate \evalN{1} of what do.
    E.g.:
    %
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{R{.40\textwidth} L{.40\textwidth}}
        \prop{2}-\val{0} pair & \prop{2}-\val{0} pairs in \pool{0} \\
        \hline
        \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{C\propI{ has a vowel}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
        \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{C\propI{ has an odd number}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
        \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{False}} & \pv{C\propI{ has consonant}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
        \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{False}} & \pv{C\propI{ has an even number}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
  \end{itemize}
  %
  Where `\(C\)' represent the relevant card.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} observes most subjects do not succeed at selection tasks.
  Hence, \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} suggests that subjects do not --- in general --- reason via the material conditional.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  There is a important subtlety to this construction.
  Subjects clearly do reason in line with the material conditional.
  For example, various definitions and ideas in this document are given with an implicit expectation that any instance \emph{if} \dots \emph{then} \dots construction is understood in line with the material conditional.

  Hence, our reconstruction of \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} does not state that subjects do not reason with the material conditional.
  Instead, the relevant \torN{} is intended to capture the idea that \emph{in general} subjects reason with conditionals via the material conditional.
  Rejecting that subjects `in general' reason with conditionals via the material conditional is compatible with subjects \emph{sometimes} reasoning with the material conditional.

  Specifying the relevant \torN{} is difficult.
  We understand there to be a difference between `reasoning via the material conditional' and `reasoning via the material conditional when implicitly or explicitly called on by the situation'.
  And, likewise, \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}'s hypothesis of three truth values does not single out any particular \torN{}, as \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} does not give a complete account of the truth values.

  Still, various other observations may be seen to parallel to our treatment of selection tasks via \autoref{def:tpro}.
  In particular, consider \citeauthor{Harman:1984aa}'s (\citeyear{Harman:1984aa,Harman:1986ux}) arguments against a strong connexion between logical principles and principles of belief revision.
  \citeauthor{Harman:1984aa} summarises:
  %
  \begin{quote}
    Logical principles are not directly rules of belief revision.
    [\dots]
    Logical principles hold universally, without exception, whereas the corresponding principles of belief revision would be at best prima facie principles, which do not always hold.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[107--108]{Harman:1984aa})}
  \end{quote}
    %
  Likewise, consider the \citeauthor{Allais:1979aa} paradox (\cite{Allais:1979aa}),
  the Ellsberg paradox (\cite{Ellsberg:1961aa}), \citeauthor{Makinson:1965aa}'s Paradox of the Preface (\citeyear{Makinson:1965aa}), \citeauthor{Kyburg:1997aa}'s Lottery Paradox (\citeyear{Kyburg:1997aa}), \citeauthor{Quinn:1990aa}'s  puzzle of the self-torturer (\citeyear{Quinn:1990aa}), \citeauthor{Bratman:1981aa}'s arguments against the desire-belief model of practical reasoning (\citeyear{Bratman:1981aa,Bratman:1987aa}), and so on.

  Common to each observation mentioned is the idea that an agent failing to conclude something shows that other instances of the agent's reasoning does not have some general characteristic.
\end{note}



\paragraph*{Powers}

\begin{note}
  Selection tasks are events which happen and highlight an \agents{} reasoning is not of some particular type.
  However, our interest with \tCN{} primarily concerns events where the agent \emph{is} \tCV{} by some type, and \autoref{idea:tC} suggests the agent would make some conclusion if some possible event were to happen.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{scenario}[Powerful multiplication]%
    \label{illu:tR:powers}%
    A student has been studying algebra and has just been introduced to the rule of multiplication for powers (\(a^{n} \cdot a^{m} = a^{n + m}\)).

    At hand are a handful of exercises (from \cite[32]{Gelfand:1993aa}):
    %
    \begin{quote}
      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{mfp:a}
        You know that \(2^{1001} \cdot 2^{n} = 2^{2000}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:b}
        You know that \(2^{1001} \cdot 2^{n} = \sfrac{1}{4}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:c}
        Which is bigger: \(10^{-3}\) or \(2^{-10}\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:d}
        You know that \(\sfrac{2^{1000}}{2^{n}} = 2^{501}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:e}
        You know that \(\sfrac{2^{1000}}{2^{n}} = \sfrac{1}{16}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:f}
        You know that \(4^{100} = 2^{n}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:g}
        You know that \(2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}\).
        What is \(a\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:h}
        You know that \((2^{10})^{15} = 2^{n}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{quote}
    %
    The student starts work on exercise~\ref{mfp:f}, and is concluding \pv{\propI{n is 200}}{\valI{True}}.
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  Intuitively, the student is reasoning with an understanding of multiplication for powers.

  Further, it seems the agent is concluding \pv{\propI{n is 200}}{\valI{True}} by an understanding of multiplication for powers \emph{only if} the agent would be concluding \pv{\propI{a is 6}}{\valI{True}} from \pv{\propM{2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}}}{\valI{True}} were the agent to abandon \ref{mfp:g} and work on~\ref{mfp:f}.

  Indeed, it is plausible exercises \ref{mfp:a} through to \ref{mfp:h} were chosen by \citeauthor{Gelfand:1993aa} to test basic competence with multiplication for powers.
  Hence, if the agent would fail to be concluding \pv{\propI{a is 6}}{\valI{True}} from \pv{\propM{2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}}}{\valI{True}} when working on~\ref{mfp:f}, then it seems the agent does not have an adequate understanding of multiplication for powers to be concluding \emph{by} an understanding of multiplication for powers.%
  \footnote{
    This may be resisted.
    For example, exercises~\ref{mfp:b},~\ref{mfp:d}, and~\ref{mfp:e} all involve fractions.
    And, the agent may be shaky on fractions, but good with multiplication by powers.
    Hence, the relevant collection \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings \(\mathcal{X}\) may only include \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings which correspond to exercises \ref{mfp:a},  \ref{mfp:c},  \ref{mfp:f},  \ref{mfp:g}, and \ref{mfp:h}.

    For broader motivation for such restrictions, consider \citeauthor{Chomsky:2015aa}'s distinction between competence and performance.
    %
    \begin{quote}
      Arithmetical competence yields the correct number z for every pair~(x,~y) under addition or multiplication.
      But only a small finite subpart of arithmetical competence can be exhibited without external aids (by calculating in one's head).
      Obviously, that fact does not imply that arithmetical competence is correspondingly limited.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[xii]{Chomsky:2015aa})}
    \end{quote}
  }
\end{note}



\begin{note}
  It may help to think of a \tpro{} in connexion to a \pool{}.

  For example, with respect to \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F} we understood the agent to conclude \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from some \pool{} which captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation.
  This suggests the agent concluded \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} \emph{by} factorising.
  For, if the agent did not conclude \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} by factorising then various \prop{0}-\val{0} pairs of the relevant \pool{} would be irrelevant.
  That is to say, if the agent concluded \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} on a whim, there would be no relevance of the \agents{} understanding of factorisation to the conclusion.

  Still, more may be said about what makes it the case that the agent concluded \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from some \pool{} which captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation.
  In particular, some thing may be said about other conclusions the agent may make given their understanding of factorisation.
  For example, if the agent were to try and \emph{fail} to correctly solve various other basic factorisation problems, then it seems the agent did not conclude \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} \emph{by} factorising.%
  \footnote{
    In other words, the agent may make other conclusions from \pool{1} which likewise capture the \agents{} understanding of factorisation.
  }

  \autoref{def:tpro} does not, strictly, require a fixed \pool{}, though the \illu{1} which follow build on the intuitive connexion between a \torN{} an a \pool{} which captures an \agents{} understanding of some thing.

    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:tCV-fc}
    Suppose conditions \ref{prop:tCV-fc:tC}, \ref{prop:tCV-fc:pro}, and \ref{prop:tCV-fc:e} hold.

    In particular, consider the event \(\edn{\sharp}\) and \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairing \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) given by Condition~\ref{prop:tCV-fc:e}.

    Our task is to show \autoref{def:fc} (\autopageref{def:fc}) holds.
    Specifically, our goal is to show clauses \ref{def:fc:ai}, \ref{def:fc:act} and \ref{def:fc:result} of \autoref{def:fc} are satisfied with respect to \(\ed{\flat}\), \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
    For, \(\ed{\flat}\) is a trivial partition of \(\ed{\flat}\) into sub-events.
    In turn:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Clause~\ref{def:fc:ai} is satisfied as Sub-condition~\ref{prop:tCV-fc:e:act:i} \(\edn{\sharp}\) is the result of an action \(a\) done by \vAgent{} in \(\ed{\flat}\).
      In other words, \(\ed{\flat}\) is an event in which the agent may do \(a\).
    \item
      Clause~\ref{def:fc:act} is satisfied as conditions \ref{prop:tCV-fc:tC} and \ref{prop:tCV-fc:pro} entail:
      % 
      \begin{quote}
        For every event \(\edn{\ast}\) and associated \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pair \(\pv{\chi}{v''}\) and \(X\) in \(\mathcal{P}\):
        \begin{itemize}
        \item
          \(\edn{\ast}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\chi}{v''}\) from \(X\).
        \end{itemize}
      \end{quote}
      % 
      So, in particular \(\edn{\sharp}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
      Hence, the event \(\edn{\sharp}\) in which the agent does \(a\) is an event in which the agent is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
    \item
      And, finally, Sub-condition~\ref{prop:tCV-fc:e:act:ii} is easily seen as equivalent to Clause~\ref{def:fc:result}.
    \end{itemize}
    % 
    So, \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) is a \fc{0} from \(\Psi\) for \vAgent{} through \(\ed{\flat}\).
  \end{argument}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  For example, consider \autoref{illu:tR:powers}.
  Agent is concluding \pv{\propI{n is 200}}{\valI{True}} by an understanding of multiplication for powers \emph{only if} the agent would be concluding \pv{\propI{a is 6}}{\valI{True}} from \pv{\propM{2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}}}{\valI{True}} were the agent to abandon \ref{mfp:g} and work on~\ref{mfp:f}.
  So, we have some collection of events, result of action.
  And, second condition is satisfied.

\section*{Summary}

\begin{note}
  This chapter introduced the idea of an agent \tCV{} some \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{} of premises (\autoref{idea:tC}).

  The idea of an agent \tCV{} is partly motivated by familiar arguments which concern an agent not reasoning by some \torN{} such as selection tasks (\cite{Wason:1966aa}) and various observations regarding decision theory (\cite{Allais:1979aa}, \cite{Ellsberg:1961aa}, \citeyear{Quinn:1990aa}), logical principles (\citeyear{Makinson:1965aa}, \citeyear{Kyburg:1997aa}, \cite{Harman:1984aa}), and practical reasoning (\citeyear{Bratman:1981aa,Bratman:1987aa}).
  Though, the idea is also motivated by common sense (cf.\ \autoref{illu:tR:powers}).
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  The key result of this chapter (\autoref{prop:tCV-fc}) linked an agent \tCV{} some \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{} of premises to various \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairing being \fc{1}.
  Specifically, \autoref{prop:tCV-fc} provides sufficient conditions for a \prop{0}-\val{0} pair being a \fc{} from some \pool{} given an agent is \tCV{}.

  \autoref{sec:typicalRequs} links the sufficient conditions for a \fc{}  to the idea of a \requ{} introduced in \autoref{cha:requs}.
  And, as a result, our argument for the failure of \issueInclusion{} will primarily turn on whether there are \scen{1} in which an agent is \tCV{} (as understood by \autoref{idea:tC}).
