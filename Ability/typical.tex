\begin{note}
  This chapter introduces and develops the idea of an agent concluding some \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{} by some \emph{type} of reasoning --- colloquially, we say the agent is agent \emph{\typeAdj{}} concluding the \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{}.

  Intuitively, an agent is \typeAdj{} concluding just in case there is some generality to the agent's reasoning which concluding.
  For example, the agent is reasoning by modus ponens, arithmetic, or the categorical imperative, etc.

\begin{note}
  The role of an agent \tCV{} in the overall argument to provide sufficient conditions for a \requ{}.
  The first section of this chapter introduces the idea of an agent \tCV{}, and the second section of this chapter provides a handful of definitions in order to link an agent \tCN{} to \fc{1}.
  In turn, \autoref{sec:typicalRequs} builds on the second section to provide sufficient conditions for a \requ{}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  At the close of the chapter all the idea relating to counterexamples to \issueInclusion{} will have been stated.

\section{\tC{2}}
\label{cha:typical:int}

\begin{note}
  Our interest is characterising an event in which an agent is concluding.
  By~\autoref{assu:ConRea} (\autopageref{assu:ConRea}), whenever an concludes, and agent reasons.
  Hence, whenever an agent is concluding, and agent is reasoning.
  And, some instances of reasoning are, intuitively, of a type:
  There are sufficiently similar characteristics between two or more events in which an agent reasons for the agent to be reasoning by `type of reasoning \(T\)', where `type of reasoning \(T\)' may be `modus ponens', `means-end reasoning', `arithmetic', `consequentialism', and so on.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  I expect this observation is intuitive, and specific examples will follow.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Our interest is stating a necessary condition for whether or not an event in which an agent is concluding is an event in which an agent's reasoning is of some type.

\subsection{\torN{3}}
\label{cha:typical:tCDef:ToRdef}

\begin{note}
  \torN{3} are defined in terms of \prop{1}, \val{1}, and \pool{1}:

  \begin{definition}[A \torN{0}]
    \label{def:tor}
    \mbox{ }
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(T\) is a \torN{}.
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(T\) is a collection of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  Intuitively, a \torN{} (as defined) as the \emph{extension} of a \torN{}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  For example, \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.

  The following \prop{2}-\val{}-\pool{} pairings are plausibly in the type `factorisation':
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      \pv{\rootsCon{}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      % \pv{\propM{x \in \{-1,1\}}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{x^{2} - 1 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \pv{\propM{x \in \{4,2\}}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{x^{2} - 4x + 8 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \pv{\propM{x \in \{70,-2\}}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{x^{2} - 68x - 140 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  %
  The following \prop{2}-\val{}-\pool{} pairings are plausibly \emph{not} in the type `factorisation':

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{R{.45\textwidth} L{.45\textwidth}}
      \pv{\rootsConBad{}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \pv{\propI{n is 2000}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{\propM{4^{100} = 2^{n}}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
      \pv{\propM{x \in \{70,-2\}}}{\valI{Want}} & \pv{\propM{x^{2} - 68x - 140 = 0}}{\valI{True}}, \dots \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  The first \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairing is not the case, the second pairing is unrelated to factorisation, and the third pairing concerns a desire, rather than what is.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \torN{3} are, for our interests, collections of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings.
  There need be no `natural' description of the type.%
  \footnote{
    Further, it need not be the case that the agent is following a rule as advocated for by, e.g.\ \textcite{Boghossian:2008vf} and \textcite{Broome:2013aa}.
    Though, a \torNa{} may be understood as the extension of some rule.

\subsection{Definition}
\label{sec:idea}


\begin{note}
  Abstractly, consider `\vAgent{} is \emph{\tCV{}} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by type of reasoning \(T\)' as a predicate of an event.
  Necessary condition for predicate.

  \begin{definition}[\tCN{2}]%
    \label{idea:tC}%
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is \emph{\tCV{}} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).\newline
      \hfill(By some type of reasoning \(T\).)
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{Only if}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      For some collections; \(\mathcal{E}\) of possible events, \(\mathcal{X}\) of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0}~pairings:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        For every event \(\ed{\prime}\), there is some \prop{0}-\val{} pair \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \pool{0} \(\Psi\) in \(\mathcal{X}\) such that:
        \begin{itenum}
        \item[\emph{If}:]
          \(\ed{\prime}\) is in the collection of events \(\mathcal{E}\).
        \item[\emph{Then}:]
          \(\ed{\prime}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
        \end{itenum}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  Intuitively, \autoref{idea:tC} expresses the idea that the predicate `\vAgent{} is \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by type of reasoning \(T\)' applies to an event only if some `law' holds.%
  \footnote{
    Note, this is distinct from the position that concluding/reasoning is rule governed.
    \cite{Boghossian:2008vf,Boghossian:2012vb}, \cite{Broome:2002aa}.

    When reasoning, following a rule.
    We are talking about \emph{type} of concluding, rather than concluding.
    But, the object is not following the predicate.
  }
  Where, `law' is understood in the colloquial sense of a universally quantified material conditional.%
  \footnote{
    For example, consider:

    \citeauthor{Helmholtz:1977aa}'s characterisation of laws of nature:%
    \begin{quote}
      \nocite{Wilson:2006aa}
      Every law of nature asserts that upon preconditions alike in a certain respect, there always follow consequences that are alike in a certain other respect.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[122]{Helmholtz:1977aa})}
    \end{quote}

    The law of large numbers:
    \begin{quote}
      Things of every kind of nature are subject to a universal law which one may well call \emph{the Law of Large Numbers}.
      It consists in that if one observes large numbers of events of the same nature depending on causes which are constant and causes which vary irregularly, \dots, one finds that the proportions of occurrence are almost constant \dots\newline
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor{Seneta:2013aa}'s (\citeyear[9--10]{Seneta:2013aa}) translation of (\cite[7]{Poisson:1837aa}))}
    \end{quote}

    The law of truly large numbers:
    \begin{quote}
      [W]hen enormous numbers of events and people and their interactions cumulate over time, almost any outrageous event is bound to occur.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[853]{Diaconis:1989aa})}
    \end{quote}
    \citeauthor{Hempel:1965aa}'s Deductive-Nomological account of scientific explanation, \citeauthor{Boole:1854aa}'s laws of thought, etc.
  }

  \autoref{idea:tC} does not specify the content of the relevant law.
  However, intuitively, the law is to capture other cases where the agent is expected to be concluding by the same type of reasoning, and requires the agent \emph{is} concluding by the same type of reasoning.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  From a very broad perspective, it may help to think of an agent by some \torN{} in connexion to a \pool{}.

  For example, with respect to \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F} we understood the agent to conclude \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from some \pool{} which captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation.
  This suggests the agent concluded \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} \emph{by} factorising.
  For, if the agent did not conclude \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} by factorising then various \prop{0}-\val{0} pairs of the relevant \pool{} would be irrelevant.
  That is to say, if the agent concluded \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} on a whim, there would be no relevance of the \agents{} understanding of factorisation to the conclusion.

  Still, more may be said about what makes it the case that the agent concluded \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} from some \pool{} which captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation.
  In particular, some thing may be said about other conclusions the agent may make given their understanding of factorisation.
  For example, if the agent were to try and \emph{fail} to correctly solve various other basic factorisation problems, then it seems the agent did not conclude \pv{\propM{\rootsCon{}}}{\valI{True}} \emph{by} factorising.%
  \footnote{
    In other words, the agent may make other conclusions from \pool{1} which likewise capture the \agents{} understanding of factorisation.
  }

  This idea express here is an instance of a more general idea which amounts to something like modal robustness.
  Sensitivity (\cite{Nozick:1981aa}) and safety (\cite{Sosa:1999aa}) conditions on knowledge are an instance of this kind of idea, as is the general intuition that a skilfully made paper aeroplane flies in a variety of conditions, etc.

  \autoref{idea:tC} does not, strictly, require a fixed \pool{}, though the \illu{1} which follow build on the intuitive connexion between a \torN{} an a \pool{} which captures an \agents{} understanding of some thing.
\end{note}


\subsection{\illu{3}}
\label{sec:illu3-1}

\begin{note}
  We give two \illu{1} of \autoref{idea:tC}.

  The first \illu{0} considers selection tasks, and more broadly links \autoref{idea:tC} to negative results concerning reasoning found in the literature.

  The second \illu{0} considers multiplication by powers, and highlights our interest with \autoref{idea:tC}.
\end{note}



\paragraph*{Selection tasks}
\nocite{Wason:1968aa}
\nocite{Wason:1971aa}
\label{par:selection-tasks}


\begin{note}
  \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} details their initial section task as follows:

  \begin{quote}
    The subjects (students) were presented with an array of cards and told that every card had a letter on one side and a number on the other side, and that either would be face upwards.
    They were then instructed to decide which cards they would need to turn over in order to determine whether the experimenter was lying in uttering the following statement:
    \emph{if a card has a vowel on one side then it has an even number on the other side}.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[145--146]{Wason:1966aa})}
  \end{quote}

  An example task is given in \autoref{fig:sectionTask}.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      cardnode/.style={
        rectangle,
        minimum width=10mm,
        minimum height=14mm,
        align=center,
        rounded corners,
        font = {\Large\sffamily},
        very thick,
      },
      node distance=5mm,
      ]

      \node[cardnode, draw] (1) {2};
      \node[cardnode, draw, right = of 1] (2) {N};
      \node[cardnode, draw, right = of 2] (3) {E};
      \node[cardnode, draw, right = of 3] (4) {1};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A selection task}
    \label{fig:sectionTask}
  \end{figure}

  \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} observes the results are consistent with the following hypothesis:%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} does not provide a detailed summary of the results.
    However, \citeauthor{Johnson-Laird:1969aa} detail results of \emph{twenty four} University College London students!
    Specifically, 19 of the 24 responded as excepted given \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}'s hypothesis.
    (\citeyear[369--370]{Johnson-Laird:1969aa}).
  }
  \begin{quote}
    Subjects assume implicitly that a conditional statement has, not two truth values, but three: true, false and `irrelevant'.
    Vowels with even numbers verify, vowels with odd numbers falsify and consonants with any number are irrelevant.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[146]{Wason:1966aa})}
  \end{quote}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Selection tasks may be understood in connexion with \autoref{idea:tC}.
  In particular:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The relevant \tocN{} \(T\) is `reasoning via the material conditional'.%
    \footnote{
      \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}'s hypothesis concerns a conditional statement having two truth values, but does not specify what these truth values are.
      Still, it is clear by inspection that these are the truth values of the material conditional.
    }
  \item
    The collection of possible events \(\mathcal{E}\) of interest contains selection tasks, plausibly taken under close to ideal circumstances.
    And,
  \item
    The collection of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings \(\mathcal{X}\) contains \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings which capture appropriate \evalN{1} of what do.
    We specify these with a variable `\(C\)' to represent the relevant card:
    %
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{R{.40\textwidth} L{.40\textwidth}}
        \prop{2}-\val{0} pair & \prop{2}-\val{0} pairs in \pool{0} \\
        \hline
        \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{C\propI{ has a vowel}}{\valI{True}} \\
        \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{True}} & \pv{C\propI{ has an odd number}}{\valI{True}} \\
        \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{False}} & \pv{C\propI{ has consonant}}{\valI{True}} \\
        \pv{C\propI{ needs to be turned over}}{\valI{False}} & \pv{C\propI{ has an even number}}{\valI{True}} \\
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
  \end{itemize}
  %
  As a consequence, \(\ed{}\) is an event when an agent is \tC{} some \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{} by reasoning via the material conditional only if the agent would succeed at a selection task.

  \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} observes most subjects do not succeed at selection tasks.
  Hence, \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} suggests that subjects do not --- in general --- reason via the material conditional.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  There is a important subtlety to this construction.
  Subjects clearly do reason in line with the material conditional.
  For example, various definitions and ideas (including \autoref{idea:tC}) in this document are given with an implicit expectation that any instance \emph{if} \dots \emph{then} \dots construction is understood in line with the material conditional.

  Hence, our reconstruction of \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} does not state that subjects do not reason with the material conditional.
  Instead, the relevant \torN{} is intended to capture the idea that \emph{in general} subjects reason with conditionals via the material conditional.
  Rejecting that subjects `in general' reason with conditionals via the material conditional is compatible with subjects \emph{sometimes} reasoning with the material conditional.

  Specifying the relevant \torN{} is difficult.
  We understand there to be a difference between `reasoning via the material conditional' and `reasoning via the material conditional when implicitly or explicitly called on by the situation'.
  And, likewise, \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}'s hypothesis of three truth values does not single out any particular \torN{}, as \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa} does not give a complete account of the truth values.

  Still, various other observations may be seen to parallel to our treatment of selection tasks via \autoref{idea:tC}.
  In particular, consider \citeauthor{Harman:1984aa}'s (\citeyear{Harman:1984aa,Harman:1986ux}) arguments against a strong connexion between logical principles and principles of belief revision.
  \citeauthor{Harman:1984aa} summarises:
  %
  \begin{quote}
    Logical principles are not directly rules of belief revision.
    [\dots]
    Logical principles hold universally, without exception, whereas the corresponding principles of belief revision would be at best prima facie principles, which do not always hold.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[107--108]{Harman:1984aa})}
  \end{quote}
    %
  Likewise, consider the \citeauthor{Allais:1979aa} paradox (\cite{Allais:1979aa}),
  the Ellsberg paradox (\cite{Ellsberg:1961aa}), \citeauthor{Makinson:1965aa}'s Paradox of the Preface (\citeyear{Makinson:1965aa}), \citeauthor{Kyburg:1997aa}'s Lottery Paradox (\citeyear{Kyburg:1997aa}), \citeauthor{Quinn:1990aa}'s  puzzle of the self-torturer (\citeyear{Quinn:1990aa}), \citeauthor{Bratman:1981aa}'s arguments against the desire-belief model of practical reasoning (\citeyear{Bratman:1981aa,Bratman:1987aa}), and so on.

  Common to each observation mentioned is the idea that an agent failing to conclude something shows that other instances of the agent's reasoning does not have some general characteristic.
\end{note}


% \paragraph*{Rules}

% \begin{note}
%   Selection tasks are events which happen, and \citeauthor{Wason:1966aa}'s hypothesis is that people \emph{in general} do not do not reason about conditionals using only \valI{True} and \valI{False}.
%   However, the events the law of \autoref{idea:tC} quantifies over need not happen, and the event at issue may be a single event.
% \end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   \begin{scenario}[Addition]%
%     \label{illu:quus}%
%     An agent is given pairs of numbers \(x\) and \(y\) and asked to respond with \(x + y\).
%     The table below represents the event as the agent responds to the pairs.

%     The agent is distracted.

%     \newline%
%   \end{scenario}

%   \noindent%
%   It seems the agent was not reasoning by addition.%
%   \footnote{
%     Rather, it seems the agent was reasoning by quaddition, following \citeauthor{Kripke:1982aa}'s (\citeyear{Kripke:1982aa}) definition of `quss':
%     \begin{align*}
%       x \text{ quss y} &= x \text{ plus } y, \text{ if } x,y < 57 \\

%   For, consider the counterfactual event.
%   The agent concluded \pv{\propI{x + y is 5}}{\valI{True}} from some \pool{} containing \pv{\propI{x is 68}}{\valI{True}} and \pv{\propI{y is 57}}{\valI{True}}.
%   Hence, it seems the agent was not concluding \pv{\propI{x + y is 125}}{\valI{True}}.

%   Further, though the counterfactual event suggests the agent was not reasoning by addition, it is less clear that the agent never reasons by addition.
%   The agent's interpretation of `\(+\)' as something other than `plus' may be no different from interpreting `\(A \land B\)' as `\(A\) and \(B\)' rather than `the meet of sets \(A\) and \(B\)'.

\paragraph*{Powers}

\begin{note}
  Selection tasks are events which happen and highlight an \agents{} reasoning is not of some particular type.
  However, our interest with \tCN{} primarily concerns events where the agent \emph{is} \tCV{} by some type, and \autoref{idea:tC} suggests the agent would make some conclusion if some possible event were to happen.

  \begin{scenario}[Powerful multiplication]%
    \label{illu:tR:powers}%
    A student has been studying algebra and has just been introduced to the rule of multiplication for powers (\(a^{n} \cdot a^{m} = a^{n + m}\)).

    At hand are a handful of exercises (from \cite[32]{Gelfand:1993aa}):
    %
    \begin{quote}
      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{mfp:a}
        You know that \(2^{1001} \cdot 2^{n} = 2^{2000}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:b}
        You know that \(2^{1001} \cdot 2^{n} = \sfrac{1}{4}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:c}
        Which is bigger: \(10^{-3}\) or \(2^{-10}\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:d}
        You know that \(\sfrac{2^{1000}}{2^{n}} = 2^{501}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:e}
        You know that \(\sfrac{2^{1000}}{2^{n}} = \sfrac{1}{16}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:f}
        You know that \(4^{100} = 2^{n}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:g}
        You know that \(2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}\).
        What is \(a\)?
      \item
        \label{mfp:h}
        You know that \((2^{10})^{15} = 2^{n}\).
        What is \(n\)?
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{quote}
    %
    The student starts work on exercise~\ref{mfp:f}, and is concluding \pv{\propI{n is 200}}{\valI{True}}.
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  Intuitively, the student is reasoning with an understanding of multiplication for powers.

  Further, it seems the agent is concluding \pv{\propI{n is 200}}{\valI{True}} by an understanding of multiplication for powers \emph{only if} the agent would be concluding \pv{\propI{a is 6}}{\valI{True}} from \pv{\propM{2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}}}{\valI{True}} were the agent to abandon \ref{mfp:g} and work on~\ref{mfp:f}.

  Indeed, it is plausible exercises \ref{mfp:a} through to \ref{mfp:h} were chosen by \citeauthor{Gelfand:1993aa} to test basic competence with multiplication for powers.
  Hence, if the agent would fail to be concluding \pv{\propI{a is 6}}{\valI{True}} from \pv{\propM{2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}}}{\valI{True}} when working on~\ref{mfp:f}, then it seems the agent does not have an adequate understanding of multiplication for powers to be concluding \emph{by} an understanding of multiplication for powers.%
  \footnote{
    This may be resisted.
    For example, exercises~\ref{mfp:b},~\ref{mfp:d}, and~\ref{mfp:e} all involve fractions.
    And, the agent may be shaky on fractions, but good with multiplication by powers.
    Hence, the relevant collection \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings \(\mathcal{X}\) may only include \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairings which correspond to exercises \ref{mfp:a},  \ref{mfp:c},  \ref{mfp:f},  \ref{mfp:g}, and \ref{mfp:h}.

    For broader motivation for such restrictions, consider \citeauthor{Chomsky:2015aa}'s distinction between competence and performance.

      Arithmetical competence yields the correct number z for every pair~(x,~y) under addition or multiplication.
      But only a small finite subpart of arithmetical competence can be exhibited without external aids (by calculating in one's head).
      Obviously, that fact does not imply that arithmetical competence is correspondingly limited.%

    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \noindent%
  \autoref{prop:tCV-fc} considers a \scen{0} in which an agent is \tCV{} and the collection of possible events and \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pair satisfies conditions.

  First condition.
  \tCV{} a collection of possible events.
  In some cases, possible events correspond to result of the agent doing some action.

  As agent is \tCV{}, then for each event, \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairing such that the agent is concluding.
  Second condition, agent does not require novel information after action is done to conclude.

  For example, consider \autoref{illu:tR:powers}.
  Agent is concluding \pv{\propI{n is 200}}{\valI{True}} by an understanding of multiplication for powers \emph{only if} the agent would be concluding \pv{\propI{a is 6}}{\valI{True}} from \pv{\propM{2^{100} \cdot 3^{100} = a^{100}}}{\valI{True}} were the agent to abandon \ref{mfp:g} and work on~\ref{mfp:f}.
  So, we have some collection of events, result of action.
  And, second condition is satisfied.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The full argument for \autoref{prop:tCV-fc}, though amounts to generalising the above reasoning by relevant definitions.

  \begin{argument}{prop:tCV-fc}
    Suppose conditions \ref{prop:tCV-fc:tC} and \ref{prop:tCV-fc:e} hold.

    By Condition~\ref{prop:tCV-fc:tC}, \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by \torNa{} \(T\).
    So, by \autoref{idea:tC} there is some collections \(\mathcal{E}\) of events and \(\mathcal{X}\) of \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0}~pairings such that:
    %
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item
      For every event \(\ed{\prime}\), there is some \prop{0}-\val{} pair \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \pool{0} \(\Psi\) in \(\mathcal{X}\) such that:
      \begin{itenum}[noitemsep]
      \item[\emph{If}:]
        \(\ed{\prime}\) is in the collection of events \(\mathcal{E}\).
      \item[\emph{Then}:]
        \(\ed{\prime}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
      \end{itenum}
    \end{itemize}
    %
    Further, Condition~\ref{prop:tCV-fc:e} concerns a sub-event \(\edn{i}\) of some partition of \(\ed{}\) into sub-events \(\edn{1}, \dots, \edn{k}\).
    In particular, there is some possible event \(\edn{\sharp}\) in \(\mathcal{E}\) and \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairing \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) in \(\mathcal{X}\) such that:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=\theenumi\alph*]
    \item
      \(\edn{\sharp}\) is the result of an action \(a\) done by the agent in \(\ed{}\).
    \item
      The agent \evals{} \(\psi'\) as having value \(v''\) prior to doing \(a\), for each \prop{0}-\val{0} pair \(\pv{\psi'}{v''}\) in \(\Psi\).
    \end{enumerate}
    By Condition \ref{prop:tCV-fc:e:act:i} and \autoref{idea:tC}, it follows that the agent is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) in \(\edn{\sharp}\).

    Now, \(\edn{i}\) is trivially a partition of \(\edn{i}\) into sub-events.
    And, as just observed there is some description \(d_{i}\) such that \(\ed{i}\) is an event in which the agent may do some action \(a_{i}\) where:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., ref=\Alph*, series=tCVFCArg]
    \item
      The event \(\ed{i+}\) in which the agent does \(a_{i}\) is an event in which the agent is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\).
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    Further, by Condition~\ref{prop:tCV-fc:e:act:ii}:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., ref=\Alph*, resume*=tCVFCArg]
    \item
      The agent \evals{} \(\psi'\) as having value \(v''\) prior to doing \(a_{i}\), for each \prop{0}-\val{0} pair \(\pv{\psi'}{v''}\) in \(\Psi\).
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    Hence, the definition of \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) being a \fc{0} from \(\Psi\) throughout \(\ed{i}\) is satisfied (cf.~\autoref{def:fc}, \autopageref{def:fc}).
  \end{argument}
\end{note}



\section*{Summary}

\begin{note}
  This chapter introduced the idea of an agent \tCV{} some \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{} of premises (\autoref{idea:tC}).

  The idea of an agent \tCV{} is partly motivated by familiar arguments which concern an agent not reasoning by some \torN{} such as selection tasks (\cite{Wason:1966aa}) and various observations regarding decision theory (\cite{Allais:1979aa}, \cite{Ellsberg:1961aa}, \citeyear{Quinn:1990aa}), logical principles (\citeyear{Makinson:1965aa}, \citeyear{Kyburg:1997aa}, \cite{Harman:1984aa}), and practical reasoning (\citeyear{Bratman:1981aa,Bratman:1987aa}).
  Though, the idea is also motivated by common sense (cf.\ \autoref{illu:tR:powers}).
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  The key result of this chapter (\autoref{prop:tCV-fc}) linked an agent \tCV{} some \prop{0}-\val{0} pair from some \pool{} of premises to various \prop{0}-\val{0}-\pool{0} pairing being \fc{1}.
  Specifically, \autoref{prop:tCV-fc} provides sufficient conditions for a \prop{0}-\val{0} pair being a \fc{} from some \pool{} given an agent is \tCV{}.

  \autoref{sec:typicalRequs} links the sufficient conditions for a \fc{}  to the idea of a \requ{} introduced in \autoref{cha:requs}.
  And, as a result, our argument for the failure of \issueInclusion{} will primarily turn on whether there are \scen{1} in which an agent is \tCV{} (as understood by \autoref{idea:tC}).
