  \begin{proposition}[\tC{2} and \requ{1}]
    \label{prop:hinge}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      Clauses~\ref{prop:hinge:A:rep},~\ref{prop:hinge:A:tI},~and~\ref{prop:hinge:A:novel} jointly hold for \(e\):
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
      \item
        \label{prop:hinge:A:rep}
        \(T'\) is a \tRep{} of \vAgent{} \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by type \(T\) in \(e\).
      \item
        \label{prop:hinge:A:tI}
        \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \tI{} of \(T'\)
      \item
        \label{prop:hinge:A:novel}
        The following conditional is true:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[\emph{If}:]
          There is some available action \(a\) such that \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\), when \vAgent{} does \(a\).
        \item[\emph{Then}:]
          There is some available action \(a'\) such that \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) without use of any novel information obtained by doing \(a'\), when \vAgent{} does \(a'\).
        \end{itemize}
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of \(e\) being an event in which \vAgent{} is \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \noindent%
  \autoref{prop:hinge}, sufficient conditions for \requ{} when \tCV{}.
  Useful proposition with respect to counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.

  Intuitive motivation for \autoref{prop:hinge} is simple.
  \autoref{prop:tC-and-fc} (\autopageref{prop:tC-and-fc}).

  If clauses hold and agent is \tCV{}, then \fc{}.
  This is exactly what is required for \requ{}.

  In detail:

  \begin{argument}{prop:hinge}
    Assume~ clauses~\ref{prop:hinge:A:rep},~\ref{prop:hinge:A:tI},~and~\ref{prop:hinge:A:novel} jointly hold.
    Suppose \tCV{}.
    Then, by \autoref{prop:tC-and-fc}, \fc{}.

    Then by \autoref{def:requ}, \requ{}.
  \end{argument}

  Recap.

  \tCV{}.
  Intuitively, various other things conclude.
  \tRep{}, requires events.
  Conditional of \autoref{prop:hinge:A:novel} strengthens so no novel information.

  As get \fc{}, then \requ{}.

  Importance of \autoref{prop:hinge} is existence of \requ{}.
  \tCV{} without novel information.

\section{\tC{2} and \issueConstraint{}}
\label{sec:tpyically-concluding}

\begin{note}
  Understand \requ{} and counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.

  Introduced \tCV{} to motivate \requ{}.

  In this section, recast previous section in terms of \tCV{}.
\end{note}

\subsection{\tCon{2}}
\label{cha:binding:tCon}

\begin{note}
  The \tCon{0} parallel the \rCon{0}.
  Difference is third.
  Rather than \requ{}, conditions sufficient for \requ{} in terms of \tCV{}.

  \begin{definition}[The \tCon{0}]
    \label{def:tCon}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The \emph{\tCon{0}} hold of \(e\) with respect to \(\langle \vAgent{}, \pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}, \pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}, e^{\flat} \rangle\).
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Conditions~%
      \ref{def:tCon:C}~and~%
      \ref{def:tCon:Cing}~%
      jointly hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
      \item
        \label{def:tCon:C}
        \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \item
        \label{def:tCon:Cing}
        There is some sub-event \(e^{\flat}\) of \(e\) such that \ref{def:tCon:sR} and \ref{def:tCon:Cing:itc} jointly hold:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\arabic{enumi}\alph*)]
        \item
          \label{def:tCon:Cing:itc}
          The following conditional is true:
          \begin{itenum}
          \item[\emph{If}:]
            \(e^{\flat}\) is not an event in which \vAgent{} is \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
          \item[\emph{Then}:]
            \(e^{\flat}\) is not, or does not develop into, an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
          \end{itenum}
        \item
          \label{def:tCon:sR}
          Conditions%
          ~\ref{def:tCon:sR:rep},%
          ~\ref{def:tCon:sR:tI}, and%
          ~\ref{def:tCon:sR:itc} %
          jointly hold:
          \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*., ref=(\arabic{enumi}\alph{enumii}.\roman*)]
          \item
            \label{def:tCon:sR:rep}
            \(T'\) is a \tRep{} of \vAgent{} \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) by type \(T\) in \(e^{\flat}\).
          \item
            \label{def:tCon:sR:tI}
            \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \tI{} of \(T'\)
          \item
            \label{def:tCon:sR:itc}
            The following conditional is true:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item[\emph{If}:]
              There is some available action \(a\) such that \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\), when \vAgent{} does \(a\).
            \item[\emph{Then}:]
              There is some available action \(a'\) such that \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) without use of any novel information obtained by doing \(a'\), when \vAgent{} does \(a'\).
            \end{itemize}
          \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-1.5\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  Similar to previous conditions.
  Two key differences.
  \ref{def:tCon:Cing}: \tCV{} rather than concluding.
  \ref{def:tCon:sR}: Rather than \requ{}, sufficient conditions for \requ{} so long as an agent is \tCV{}.

  In short, we slightly strengthen \ref{def:tCon:Cing} to provide a more specific account of the \scen{1} of interest.
\end{note}

\subsection{\tCon{2}, \qWhyV{} and \issueConstraint{}}
\label{sec:tccon2-qwhyv-}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}[\tCV{3} and \qWhyV{}]
    \label{prop:tCV-WhyV}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      The \tCon{0} hold of \(e\) with respect to \(\langle \vAgent{}, \pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}, \pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}, e^{\flat} \rangle\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\), in part, answers \qWhyV{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-1.5\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  Instead of \requ{} directly, strengthen to \tCV{} and sufficient conditions for \requ{} given \tCV{}.

  \begin{argument}{prop:tCV-WhyV}
    The argument parallels \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV} with  minor adjustment.

    Rather appeal to Sub-condition~\ref{def:rCs:Cing:requ} of the \rCon{} to observe \(e^{\flat}\) is not an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), appeal to Sub-condition~\ref{def:tCon:sR} of the \tCon{} to observe \(e^{\flat}\) is not an event in which \vAgent{} is \tCV{} \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    And, with this observation in hand appeal to Sub-condition~\ref{def:tCon:Cing:itc} to observe \(e^{\flat}\) is not, or does not develop into, an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  \end{argument}

  \noindent%
  With \autoref{prop:tCV-WhyV} in hand, we observe the relevant parallel to \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces}:

  \begin{proposition}[\tCV{3} and \issueConstraint{}]
    \label{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      The \tCon{0} hold of \(e\) with respect to \(\langle \vAgent{}, \pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}, \pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}, e^{\flat} \rangle\).
    \item[\emph{And}:]
      \vAgent{} does not have a \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Psi\) when \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a counterexample to \issueConstraint{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:tCV-WhyV-ces}
    Adapt the argument for \autoref{prop:requ-WhyV-ces} with \autoref{prop:tCV-WhyV}.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}

\subsection{Additional upshots}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  \tCV{2} motivates, and also takes care of a potential objection, which is somewhat standard.

  Something like, explanation supervenes on facts.
  If possible to change facts while explanation holds, then those facts are not explanatory.

  Things hinge of \requ{}.
  Change whether something is a \requ{}.
  Intuitively, agent still concludes.

  In short, it's not the case that \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
  For, possible for \ros{} to fail while agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  In general this may be true.

  However, in this case, the agent is not \tCV{}.

  For, if \ros{} fails then not \fc{}, and hence agent is not \tCV{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Second, agency.

  \tCV{}, then agency.

  Else, it's accidental to what the agent is doing that they're \tCV{}.
  And, in some cases I think this may be right, but not in general.

  The agent \emph{is} \tCV{}.
  It is not merely the case that the agent \emph{happens to be} \tCV{}.
\end{note}

% \begin{note}[Problems of induction]
%   Hence, the sketch does not apply to black ravens.
%   I wouldn't conclude all ravens are black if I saw a white raven.

%   I may worry about shortly seeing a white raven when concluding all ravens are black, and I may refuse to entertain the possibility that the sun will rise tomorrow when planning to mow the grass.

%   However, it's not possible to reason to seeing a white raven, nor is it possible to reason to the sun not rising tomorrow.

%   Abstractly, at issue in~\autoref{illu:lost-key} is the possibility of failing to a reason to some proposition-value pair given \emph{present} information, rather than the possibility of failing to a reason to some proposition-value pair given \emph{new} information.

%   To the extent that problems of induction arise from receiving new information, what is at issue is distinct.%
%   \footnote{
%     See~\textcite{Henderson:2020wb} for more on the problem of induction.
%   }

%   Similar points for external world scepticism.
%   Would not conclude that I have hand if disembodied brain in a vat.

%   However, conclusion is out of reach.
% \end{note}

    %   \footnote{
    %     The present point is similar to issues raised by \citeauthor{Harman:1973ww} (\citeyear{Harman:1973ww}) regarding the proposed equivalence between reasons for which an agent believes something with reasons the agent would offer if asked to justify their belief.
    %     As \citeauthor{Harman:1973ww} notes, an agent may offer reasons because they think they will convince their audience, not because the agent is compelled by the reasons, etc.
    %     (\citeyear[Ch.2]{Harman:1973ww})

    %     To the extent that \citeauthor{Harman:1973ww}'s point is that what holds from an \agpe{} need not actually be the case, the point in the same.
    %     However, to the extent that \citeauthor{Harman:1973ww} relies on an under-specification of what holds from an \agpe{} --- i.e.\ the distinction between whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from the \agpe{} or whether the agent evaluates as true the proposition that their audience is responsive to \(\phi\) having value \(v\), the point is distinct.
