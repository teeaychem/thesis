\chapter{Events, in progress}
\label{cha:events-progress}


\begin{note}
  Our interest is understanding the way an event in which an agent concludes happens.

  This chapter outlines our understanding of both events and events (such that some other event is) in progress.
  
  This understanding is then applied to an events in which an agent concludes and event in which an agent concludes is in progress --- or colloquially an event in which an agent is concluding --- throughout the rest of the document.

  A key takeaway of this chapter is `\progEx{}' which expands on \autoref{idea:why} (\autoref{cha:intro}, \autopageref{idea:why}) and characterises the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{} in terms of features of an event in progress.

\section{Events}
\label{sec:events}

\begin{note}
  We understand events in a broadly (Neo-)\citeauthor{Davidson:1967aa}ian framework.
  In short:
  Events are things we refer to by way of descriptions which are true of the event.%
    \footnote{
      Keeping track of both events and descriptions gives me a headache, and perhaps it gives you a headache too.
      I tried to avoid the complication, but the headache was almost unbearable.

      Notation introduced below is designed so that a description is easy to ignore when it is of little importance.
      And, when a description is important attention will be drawn to its importance.
      Unfortunately, descriptions are fairly important through this chapter, though less so in later chapters.
    }

  For example, a natural language sentence such as:
  % 
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*), series=ESERIES]
  \item
    \label{ESERIES:toast}
    Sam buttered some toast in the kitchen.
  \end{enumerate}
  % 
  Is understood as saying there is some event \(\edn{}\) such that \(\edn{}\) is a butter event, the agent of \(\edn{}\) is Sam, the theme of \(\edn{}\) is some toast, and the location of \(\edn{}\) is the kitchen.%
  \footnote{
    Alternatively:
    \(\exists e [\textsc{butter}(e)\text{ \& }\textsc{agent}(e, \text{Sam})\text{ \& }\exists x(\textsc{theme}(e, \text{toast}(x)))\text{ \& }\textsc{in}(e, \text{the kitchen})]\)
  }

  Likewise:
  % 
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*), resume*=ESERIES]
  \item
    \label{ESERIES:gistCalcEq}
    Max concludes \gistCalcEq{} has value \valI{True}.
  \end{enumerate}
  % 
  Is understood as sating there is some event \(\edn{}\) such that \(\edn{}\) is a conclude event, the agent of \(\edn{}\) is Max, the \prop{0} of \(\edn{}\) is \gistCalcEq{} and the \val{} of \(\edn{}\) is \valI{True}.

  As events are referred to by descriptions true of the event, a description captures a specific event only if there is a unique event which satisfies the description.

  So, neither \ref{ESERIES:toast} nor \ref{ESERIES:gistCalcEq} explicitly refer to a unique event.
  For example, the description of \ref{ESERIES:toast} is compatible with Sam buttering three or five pieces of toast and doing so yesterday or a few months ago.
  Likewise \ref{ESERIES:gistCalcEq} is compatible with Max using a calculator or their understanding of arithmetic to conclude \gistCalcEq{} has value \valI{True}.

  Still, when discussing events we will almost always have a specific event.
  For our purposes the role of descriptions is to highlight particular features of events.%
  \footnote{
    In particular, both \qWhy{} and \qHow{} are asked with respect to a specific event.
  }
  Hence, the ease the way we talk about events, we make use of following notation:

  \begin{notation}[Events and descriptions]%
    \label{assu:HaUniqueD}%
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\edn{}\) picks out a specific event (i.e.\ an event under some unique description).
    \item
      \(\ed{}\) captures (the specific event) \(\edn{}\) under the particular description \(\edo{}\).
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{notation}

  \noindent%
  For example, given \autoref{assu:HaUniqueD} we may re-express \ref{ESERIES:gistCalcEq} to capture a specific event by writing:
  %
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*\('\)., ref=(\arabic*\('\))]
    \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item
    The event \(\edn{}\) under description \(\edo{}\) `Max concludes \gistCalcEq{} has value \valI{True}'.
  \end{enumerate}
  %
  Where \(\edn{}\) captures all features of the event, such as when the event took place, the method by which Max concluded \gistCalcEq{} has value \valI{True}, how many times Max blinked while concluding, and so on.
\end{note}



\begin{note}
  Some technicalities (such as our use of \prop{1}, \val{1}, and \pool{1}) constrain the descriptions we use, but something like `the agent concluded \gistCalcEq{} has value \valI{True} for the first time by using a calculator' is about the level of detail I have in mind, though what follows is compatible with additional detail.
\end{note}




\section{Events in progress}
\label{sec:events-progress}


\begin{note}
  Our interest is understanding the way an event in which an agent concludes happens.
  And, the idea of an event is progress is a key idea with respect to our understanding of the way an event in which an agent concludes happens.

  This section briefly characterises the way in which we understand events in progress, and states two important assumptions we may about events in progress.

  Stated a little more carefully, our interest is with events such that the event is described as being an event in which some other event is in progress.
  Still, `events in progress' is a little easier to parse.
\end{note}



\subsection{Events in progress}


\begin{note}
  Events in progress are intuitively understood in terms of the progressive aspect.

  For example:
  % 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    The agent is making soup.\newline
    \mbox{ } \hfill \(\leadsto\) An event in which the agent makes soup is in progress.
  \item
    The agent is reading Henley's `Invictus'.\newline
    \mbox{ } \hfill \(\leadsto\) An event in which the agent reads Henley's `Invictus' is in progress.
  \item
    The agent is riding the slope.\newline
    \mbox{ } \hfill \(\leadsto\) An event in which the agent rides the slope is in progress.
  \end{enumerate}
  % 
  Intuitively:

  \begin{intuition}[Events in progress and the progressive]
    \label{def:es-in-prog}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \(\ed{\ast}\) is in progress.
    \end{itemize}
    % 
    \emph{If and only if}:
    % 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\edo{}\) entails \(\edo{\ast}\) is happening.\newline
      \mbox{ }\hfill (Where \(\edo{\ast}\) is happening is understood in terms of the progressive aspect.)
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-.5\baselineskip}
  \end{intuition}

  \noindent%
  For example, going by \autoref{def:es-in-prog}, the following are equivalent:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(\ed{}\) is an event in which Max concludes \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} is \valI{True} is in progress.
  \item
    \(\edo{}\) is true of \(\edn{}\) and entails \text{Max concludes \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has \val{0} \valI{True}} is happening.
  \item
    \(\edo{}\) is true of \(\edn{}\) and entails Max is concluding \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} is \valI{True}.
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent%
  We assume an implicit understanding of the progressive aspect,%
  \footnote{
    \nocite{Portner:1998um}
    \nocite{Engelberg:1999vi}
    Note, though, that English does not have a quick, unambiguous, way of expressing events in progress.
    For, consider the sentence:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
    \item
      \label{prog:abmig}
      \textquote{John is studying for an exam}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \ref{prog:abmig} may be understand to express either the continuous or progressive aspect.

    Under the continuous aspect, \ref{prog:abmig} captures something about John, rather than something about an event happening.
    Hence, it need to be the case that John is engaged in an event of studying when \ref{prog:abmig} is said.
    For example, we may expand:
    \textquote{Sam is studying for an exam, but is taking a short nap.}

    By contrast, \ref{prog:abmig} under the progressive captures an event in where John studying is in progress.
    For example, we may expand:
    \textquote{Sam is studying for an exam, so they aren't taking a nap.}

    See,~\textcite{Richards:1981wo},~\textcite{Portner:2011vi}, etc for a general overview of the progressive.
    In particular, I suggest \textcite{Landman:1992wh} as an nice technical introduction.
    \citeauthor{Szabo:2004ul} (\citeyear[34]{Szabo:2004ul}) provides a concise summary:
    \begin{quote}
      [A] progressive sentence is true at some time just in case some event occurs at that time, and if we follow the development of the event (within our world as long as it goes, then jumping into a nearby world, and iterating the process within the limits of reasonability) we will reach a possible world where the perfective correlate is true of the continuation.
    \end{quote}
    For a more in depth summary see (\cite[764--766]{Portner:1998um}) and for some issues with \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}'s account, see
    (\cite{Bonomi:1997uq}),
    (\cite[49--50]{Engelberg:1999vi}),
    (\cite[35]{Szabo:2004ul}),
    (\cite[767]{Portner:1998um}),
    and (\cite[1256]{Portner:2011vi}).
  }
  and explicitly assume a common feature of analyses of the progressive holds of events in progress:%
  \footnote{
    See, e.g.:
    (\cite{Bennett:1972uw}),
    (\cite{Dowty:1979vq}),
    (\cite{Parsons:1990aa}),
    (\cite{Landman:1992wh}), and
    (\cite{Portner:1998um}).

    \assuPP{2} is sometimes motivated by the imperfective paradox (\cite{Dowty:1979vq}, \cite{Bach:1986tb}).
    %(\cite[Ch.3.1]{Dowty:1979vq}, \cite[12]{Bach:1986tb}).
  }

  \begin{assumption}[\assuPP{2}]%
    \label{assu:PP}%
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \(\ed{\ast}\) is in progress.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      There is some \progAdj{0} event \(\edn{\sharp}\) such that~\ref{assu:PP:pe:dev} and~\ref{assu:PP:pe:verb} are both true:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*., ref=(\roman*)]
      \item
        \label{assu:PP:pe:dev}
        \(\edn{\sharp}\) is a development of \(\edn{}\).
      \item
        \label{assu:PP:pe:verb}
        \(\edo{\sharp}\) is true of \(\edn{\sharp}\), where \(\edo{\sharp}\) is the perfective correlate of \(\edo{\ast}\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{assumption}
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Interest with the progressive]
  The immediate role of \assuPP{} is to help fix intuitions about events in progress by reflecting on the sense of possibility at issue.%
  \footnote{
    \assuPP{2} is denied by some.
    For example, \citeauthor{Szabo:2004ul} argues:
    \textquote{Sometimes we are \emph{doing} things even though there is no real chance that we could get them \emph{done}, and this is true even if we abstract away from the possibility of miraculous intervention.}
    (\citeyear[40]{Szabo:2004ul})
    E.g., \citeauthor{Szabo:2004ul} denies~\ref{Szabo:Arch} is necessarily false:
    \begin{quote}
      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*), ref=(\arabic*)]
        \setcounter{enumi}{12}
      \item
        \label{Szabo:Arch}
        As the architect was building the cathedral he knew that, although he would be building it for another year or so, he couldn't possibly complete it.%
        \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[38]{Szabo:2004ul})}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{quote}
    Though,~\ref{Szabo:Arch} seems always false to me.
    The only sense with which I read~\ref{Szabo:Arch} as true under the progressive requires factivity of knowledge to fail, thus allowing the cathedral to be built.

    See (\cite[1245]{Portner:2011vi}) for additional, distinct, discussion of (\cite{Szabo:2004ul}).
  }
  The deferred role of \assuPP{} is to help motivate a couple of ideas introduced in later chapters, and ease a handful of arguments.%
  \footnote{
    Specifically, \fc{1} in \autoref{cha:fcs} and \ros{1} in \autoref{cha:ros}.
  }

  We make three observations to help firm intuition.

  \begin{observation}[\assuPP{2} and existential modality]%
    \label{obs:prog-not-reg-poss}%
    The sense of possibility in \assuPP{} does not reduce to existential \{logical, metaphysical, nomic, \dots\} possibility.
  \end{observation}
  \begin{motivation}{obs:prog-not-reg-poss}
    Suppose an agent is sitting a multiple choice exam.
    To pass the exam the agent only needs to chose some number of correct choices.
    It is certainly logically, metaphysically, and nomically possible that the agent chooses a sufficient number of correct choices.
    However, it does not follow that the agent is passing the exam.%
    \footnote{
      See also Igal Kvart's example of Mary wiping out the Roman army (\cite[18]{Landman:1992wh}).
    }
  \end{motivation}

  \begin{observation}[\assuPP{2} and counterfactuals]%
    \label{obs:prog-not-cfs}%
    There is no simple relation between the sense of possibility in \assuPP{} and counterfactuals.
  \end{observation}
  \begin{motivation}{obs:prog-not-cfs}
    Suppose an agent is passing an exam without external help.
    Then, a classmate passes the agent some answers, which the agent uses.
    The agent is no longer passing the exam without external help.
    And, any close possible world where the classmate does not pass answers, some other classmate may pass the same answers.
  \end{motivation}

  \begin{observation}[\assuPP{} and uniqueness]%
    \label{obs:prog-no-unique}%
    The progressive may be true of an event without the event being sufficiently developed to `indicate' a unique outcome.
  \end{observation}
  \begin{motivation}{obs:prog-no-unique}
    Suppose an agent has drawn a straight line on a piece of paper.
    It may be true that the agent is drawing a triangle.
    However, the straight line is compatible with the agent drawing an \(n\)-sided polygon, for any \(n\) within a some reasonable bound.%
    \footnote{
      This observation is inspired by \citeauthor{Dowty:1979vq}'s example involving a circle and a triangle (\citeyear[133]{Dowty:1979vq}).
    }
  \end{motivation}

  \noindent%
  Loosely paraphrased, if an event is in progress, then intuitively there is \emph{something} about the way things are which ensures the existence of a possible completion event (\autoref{obs:prog-no-unique}) which is robust against external influence (\autoref{obs:prog-not-cfs}) and does not require luck (\autoref{obs:prog-not-reg-poss}).
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Finally, a brief observation highlights a quirk \autoref{assu:HaUniqueD}:

  \begin{observation}[Events in progress and common satisfaction]%
    \label{obs:eip-partial}%
    Sometimes, when \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \(\ed{\ast}\) is in progress, \(\edo{\ast}\) may be satisfied by multiple events.
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{obs:eip-partial}
    Consider an agent flipping a coin until it lands heads or lands tails ten times in a row.
    Given sufficient determination from the agent, it is true that an event in which the agent flips a coin until it lands heads or lands tails ten times in a row is in progress.

    Now, a unique event in which the agent flips a coin until it lands heads or lands tails ten times in a row involves an \(i\)th throw the coin lands heads on, or ten throws in which the coin lands tails.
    However, by \autoref{cons:no-f-ref}, it must be true of \(\ed{}\) that \(\ed{\ast}\) is in progress.
    And, as coin flips are quite random (\cite{Gelman:2002ww}), \(\ed{}\) may fail to entail that the coin lands heads on the \(i\)th throw the coin lands heads, or that the coin lands tails on all ten throws.

    Hence, if \(\ed{}\) fails to entail either that the coin lands heads on the \(i\)th throw the coin lands heads, or that the coin lands tails on all ten throws, then \(\ed{\ast}\) may be satisfied by either event.
  \end{motivation}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Note, given \autoref{assu:HaUniqueD}, \(\ed{\ast}\) being an event in which \(\ed{}\) is in progress is distinct from \(\ed{\ast}\) being an event in which \(\edn{}\) is in progress.
  For, \(\ed{}\) being in progress only requires the features of \(\edn{}\) as captured by description \(\edo{}\) are in progress.
  And, by contrast, \(\edn{}\) being in progress requires all the features of \(\edn{}\) are in progress.

  For example, suppose \(\edn{}\) is an event in which an agent completes a crossword without using a dictionary and an earlier event \(\edn{\ast}\) in which the agent is completing the crossword.
  Given the description \(\edo{\ast}\) `the agent is completing the crossword' it follows \(\edn{}\) under the description `the agent completes the crossword' is in progress.
  However, it does not follow that the agent completing the crossword without using a dictionary is in progress.
  For, without expanding \(\edo{\ast}\) we have no guarantee the agent may solve the crossword without using a dictionary.

  In this respect, it may seem a little underhand to mention \(\edn{}\).
  For, to say \(\edn{}\) is in progress is really just to say there is \emph{some} event in progress such that \(\edo{}\) is true of the event.
  However, the option of referencing additional features of \(\edn{}\) not captured by \(\edo{}\) will be used below.
\end{note}




\subsection{An constraint and an assumption}
\label{sec:assumptions-1}


\paragraph*{The constraint}


\begin{note}
  We place one important constraint on descriptions:

  \begin{constraint}{Fog}{Fog}%
    \label{cons:no-f-ref}%
    A description \(\edo{}\) of an event \(\edn{}\) is limited to what is true of \(\edn{}\) when \(\edn{}\) happens.
  \end{constraint}

  \noindent%
  \autoref{cons:no-f-ref} rules out describing an event by using information what happens after the relevant event happens and is important given the way hindsight interacts with descriptions of events.
  To illustrate, consider the following passage from \citeauthor{Bhatt:2008aa} (\citeyear{Bhatt:2008aa}) with respect to ability:%
  \footnote{
    Similarly, \citeauthor{Austin:1961vz} remarks `it follows merely from the premiss that he does it, that he has the ability to do it, according to ordinary English' (\citeyear[175]{Austin:1961vz})
    And, \textcite{Taylor:2011uh} write:
    \begin{quote}
      Consider, then, the R-statement (S):

      \begin{quote}
        Stilpo walks through the Diomean Gate at t\textsubscript{2}
      \end{quote}

      and assume that statement, tenselessly expressed so as to avoid ambiguity in what follows, to be true.

      [\dots]
      if S is true, then it follows that Stilpo was able to be walking through the gate at t\textsubscript{2}, that being, in fact, precisely what he was doing.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[139--143]{Taylor:2011uh})}
    \end{quote}
    %
    For more, see \citeauthor{Boylan:2020aa}'s discussion of `Past Success' (\citeyear[\S1.1]{Boylan:2020aa}).
  }
  %
  \begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumi}{314}
    \item
      (from~\cite{Thalberg:1969ta})
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(315\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{Bhatt:Thal-a}
        Yesterday, Brown hit three bulls-eyes in a row.
        Before he hit three bulls-eyes, he fired 600 rounds, without coming close to the bullseye; and his subsequent tries were equally wild.
      \item
        \label{Bhatt:Thal-b}
        Brown was able to hit three bulls-eyes in a row.
      \item
        \label{Bhatt:Thal-c}
        Brown had the ability to hit three bulls-eyes in a row.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    From~\ref{Bhatt:Thal-a}, we can conclude~\ref{Bhatt:Thal-b} but not~\ref{Bhatt:Thal-c}.
    Brown could have hit the target three times in a row by pure chance and he does not need to have had any ability for~\ref{Bhatt:Thal-b} to be true.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[167]{Bhatt:2008aa})}
  \end{quote}
  %
  Personally, I read \ref{Bhatt:Thal-b} and \ref{Bhatt:Thal-c} as synonyms.
  Still, the distinction \citeauthor{Bhatt:2008aa} highlights is clear.
  Expressed in terms of events in progress:
  When Brown was throwing darts it was not the Brown was throwing three bulls-eyes in a row, as Brown may have missed the dartboard on any throw.
  However, in hindsight one may say Brown was hitting three bulls-eyes in a row, as Brown hit three bulls-eyes in a row.

  Given \autoref{cons:no-f-ref} Brown was hitting three bulls-eyes only if something about the event in which Brown was throwing darts made it the case that Brown was hitting three bulls-eyes in a row regardless of what may be said with hindsight.

  The same applies to conclusions.
  For example, suppose an agent has completed a crossword.
  Intuitively, with hindsight an event in which the agent completes the crossword puzzle was in progress while the agent worked on the puzzle.
  However, it may not have been the case that an event in which the agent completes the crossword puzzle was in progress in the sense of interest.
  For, the agent may only have figured out a world by randomly stringing together vowels and consonants, and the agent may have failed to hit upon the right string to jog their memory.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  In broader context, our interest in this document is understanding the way an event in which an agent concludes happens.
  The role of events in progress is to help understand the way an event in which an agent concludes happens, and \autoref{cons:no-f-ref} ensures any explanation given is not informed by hindsight.

  In short, the explanations of interest do not do so with the benefit of hindsight.
\end{note}



% \begin{note}
%   \nocite{Hackl:1998tt}
%   May be helpful to think of ability.
%   Still, fraught.

%   \nocite{Maier:2018uo}
%   First, in the terminology of \citeauthor{Whittle:2010wr} of interest are specific (or local) ability which concern `what the agent is able to do now, in some particular circumstances', rather than general (or global) abilities which concern `what an agent is able to do in a large range of circumstances'. (\citeyear[2]{Whittle:2010wr}).%
%   \footnote{
%     See also \citeauthor{Austin:1961vz}'s (\citeyear{Austin:1961vz}) distinction between `categorical' abilities and opportunities.

%     In particular, this sets aside accounts of ability such as~\citeauthor{Carter:2021wd}'s~(\citeyear{Carter:2021wd}) `fallibilist',~\citeauthor{Kikkert:2022wp}'s~(\citeyear{Kikkert:2022wp}) `robust', and \citeauthor{Maier:2013vk}'s (\citeyear{Maier:2013vk}) `general' account, among others.
%   }

%   Second, specific ability is often accoppandied by a `control' intution.
%   For example,
%   `[A]n agent has the ability to \(\phi\) iff there are accessible worlds at which she \(\phi\)s simply by deciding to \(\phi\).' (\citeyear[19]{Schwarz:2020aa})

%   This is far stronger than an event in progress.

%   At issue is that a conclusion may be in progress even through there is no action available to the agent which results in the conclusion.
%   In particular, to adhere to some strategy is not to perform a single action.
%   For example, consider an agent working on a crossword.
%   So long as the agent is quite good at crosswords and the crossword is not too difficult, it is plausible an event in which the agent concludes all the words is in progress.
%   However, conclusion is not the result of a single act.
%   For, as the agent works through the crossword they develop additional hints, and reasoning builds on those hints.

%   Of course, \assuPP{} gets a world, but not necessarily that this is a result of deciding or any other action that may be specified in advance.%
%   \footnote{
%     Similar accounts of the control intuition are found in (\cite{Brown:1988tl}), (\cite{Horty:1995wu}), (\cite{Jaster:2020wv}), and (\cite{Kikkert:2022wp}).
%     Further, the control intuition is a key feature of both \citeauthor{Mandelkern:2017aa}'s (\citeyear{Mandelkern:2017aa}) and \citeauthor{Boylan:2020aa}'s (\citeyear{Boylan:2020aa}) `act conditional' analysis of ability.
%     Abstracting from a few minor details, the act conditional analysis of ability states:
%     %
%     \begin{quote}
%       `\(S\) is able to \(\varphi\)' is true just in case there is some action \(A\) available to \(S\) such that if \(S\) tried to \(A\) then S would \(\varphi\).
%     \end{quote}
%     %
%     Formally:
%     %
%     \[%
%       \sem[c,w]{\text{S is able to }\varphi} = 1\text{ iff }\exists A \in \mathcal{A}_{S,c,w,t}\colon \forall v \in f_{c}(\text{S does }A,w),  \sem[c,v]{\varphi(S)} = 1%
%     \]
%     %
%     Where:
%     %
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%       \(f_{c}\) is a selection function from proposition-world pairings to set of worlds.
%     \item
%       \(\mathcal{A}_{S,c,w}\) is the set of actions that are available to \(S\) in context \(c\) and world \(w\).
%     \end{itemize}
%     %
%     In other words, \(S\text{ is able to }\varphi\) is true at some world \(w\) in context \(c\), just in case there is some action available to the agent, such that for every world in which it is true that \(S\text{ tries to}A\) determined by the selection function \(f_{c}\), it is the case that \(S \varphi\text{s}\).

%     The primary difference between the analyses of \citeauthor{Mandelkern:2017aa} and \citeauthor{Boylan:2020aa} is the specification of \(f_{c}\).
%     For \citeauthor{Mandelkern:2017aa},
%     \(f_{c}\) is~\citeauthor{Stalnaker:1968vt}'s selection function.
%     I.e.\ \(f_{c}(\psi, w) = \{\text{\emph{the} `closest' world to }w\text{ where }\psi\text{ is true.}\}\).
%     (\citeyear[Cf.][314]{Mandelkern:2017aa}).
%     (Though, a `\citeauthor{Lewis:1973th}ian' approach that allows multiple close worlds seems viable.)

%     In contrast, \citeauthor{Boylan:2020aa}'s \(f_{c}\) selects all (possibly indeterminate) worlds which are identical to \(w\) up until time \(t\) (in which \(S\) does \(A\)).
%     (\citeyear[\S3.3]{Boylan:2020aa})

%     For our purposes, the key part of the act conditional analysis is not the details of the relevant selection function, but the observation that \(S \varphi\)s \emph{follows from} \(S\text{ does }A\) in all worlds captured by the selection function.
%     This is the control intuition --- the agent doing some action results in \(\phi\) being the case.

\paragraph*{The assumption}


\begin{note}
  Given \autoref{def:es-in-prog} the progressive helps fix intuitions about what it is for an event (under some description) to be such that some other event (under some other description) is in progress.
  However, we may the following key assumption which may conflict with intuitions about the progressive:

  \begin{assumption}[Exclusive progress]
    \label{assu:p:ex}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      It is not possible for \(\edo{\#}\) and \(\edo{\$}\) to both be true of an event.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      For any event \(e\):
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        It is not possible for \(\ed{\flat}\) to be an event such that \(\ed[\#]{}\) is in progress \emph{and} \(\ed[\$]{}\) is in progress.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{assumption}

  \noindent%
  Paraphrased, \autoref{assu:p:ex} assumes that if an event is in progress, then no incompatible event is (also) in progress.

  For example:
  It is not possible for both team A wins the game of hockey and for team B to wins the game of hockey to be true of an event.
  So, by \autoref{assu:p:ex}, it is not possible for team A to be winning the game of hockey and for team B to be winning the game of hockey.
  Hence, if team A is winning the game of hockey, team B is not winning the game of hockey.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  I take \autoref{assu:p:ex} to be intuitive.
  Still, \autoref{assu:p:ex} does not clearly hold of the progressive.
  For example, \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh} writes:%
  \footnote{
    See \textcite{Bonomi:1997uq} for additional discussion.
  }

  \begin{quote}
    Suppose I was on a plane to Boston which got hijacked and landed in Bismarck, North Dakota.
    What was going on before the plane was hijacked?
    One thing I can say is:
    `I was flying to Boston when the plane was hijacked'
    This is reasonable.
    But another thing I could say is:
    `I was flying to Boston.
    Well, in fact, I wasn't, I was flying to Bismarck, but I didn't know that at the time'
    And this is also reasonable.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[30--31]{Landman:1992wh})}
  \end{quote}
  %
  \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}'s observation is plausibly incompatible with \autoref{assu:p:ex} to the extent if it is reasonable to say `I was flying to Boston' \emph{and} `I was flying to Bismarck', then it may be the case that `I was flying to Boston' \emph{and} `I was flying to Bismarck'.

  More could be said.
  For example, \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}'s first statement is implicitly (and the explicitly clarified as) given with respect to what they knew, and \citeauthor{Landman:1992wh}'s second statement takes into account details about what happened after the event (cf.\ our \autoref{cons:no-f-ref}).
  However, I see no real benefit in raising \autoref{def:es-in-prog} to a definition by digressing into an account of the progressive.%
  \footnote{
    Though, an account of the progressive which ties the progressive to causation, such as \citeauthor{Szabo:2004ul}'s (\citeyear{Szabo:2004ul}) account, arguably entails \autoref{assu:p:ex}.
  }
  Hence, \autoref{assu:p:ex} captures an important way in which our understanding of an event in progress may differ from the progressive aspect.

\section{\se{3} and \progEx{}}
\label{sec:se3-progex}


\begin{note}
  Events, events in progress.

  The role of events in progress is to help understand the way an event in which an agent concludes happens.
  This section outlines the way in which events in progress help understand the way an event in which an agent concludes happens.

  This section is split into two sub-sections.

  The first sub-section introduces the idea of a `\se{}'.
  And, with the idea of a \se{} in hand, the second section links \se{} to explanations which involve `why' with the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{} by a pair of propositions we collectively term `\progEx{}'.
\end{note}



\subsection{\se{3}}

\begin{note}
  An \se{} is an event \(\edn{\flat}\) under some description \(\edo{\flat}\) such that some other event \(\edn{}\) under description \(\edo{}\) is in progress and \(\ed{}\) (in part) as a result \(\ed{\flat}\).

  The `p' in `\se{}' stands for `progress' and the `r' stands for `result'.

  We define \se{1}, make a few observations, and then apply the definition of a \se{} to \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \begin{definition}[\se{3}]
    \label{def:se}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \emph{\se{0}} of \(\ed{}\).
    \end{itemize}
    \emph{If and only if}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Clauses~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} and \ref{assu:p:se:hCon} hold:
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., ref=\Alph*]
      \item
        \label{assu:p:se:prog}
        \(\ed{\flat}\) is such that \(\ed{}\) is in progress.
      \item
        \label{assu:p:se:hCon}
        \(\ed{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  \noindent%
  \(\ed{\flat}\) being a \emph{\se{0}} of \(\ed{}\) concerns specific events \(\edn{\flat}\) and \(\edn{}\).
  And, of interest is whether specific descriptions \(\edo{}\) and \(\edo{\flat}\) capture a particular connexion between \(\edn{\flat}\) and \(\edn{}\).

  Still, our interest is only with parts of \(\edn{\flat}\) and \(\edn{}\), respectively.
  Intuitively:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} `looks forward':

    The description \(\edo{\flat}\) of \(\edn{\flat}\) captures that an event described by \(\edo{}\) is in progress.
  \item
    Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:hCon} `looks backward':

    \(\edn{}\) as described by \(\edo{}\) happened in part as a result of \(\edn{\flat}\) as described by \(\edo{\flat}\).
  \end{itemize}

  The role of Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} is to ensure the event \(\edn{}\) is favoured over some other event.
  For, by \autoref{assu:p:ex} as \(\ed{}\) is in progress, it is not the case that \(\ed[x]{}\) is in progress, grating it is not possible for \(\edo{}\) and \(\edo{x}\) to both be true of an event.

  And, the role of Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:hCon} is to ensure \(\edn{}\) happens as a result of being favoured.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  The role of clauses~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} and \ref{assu:p:se:hCon} combined to give answers to `why' (in the sense of \qWhy{}) \(\ed{}\) happened.
  Still, for the moment our interest is with what clauses~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} and \ref{assu:p:se:hCon} say rather than their role.

  As Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} simply places a constraint on the relevant description \(\edo{\flat}\) our discussion focuses on Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:hCon}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  I have little to say in abstract about what is it is for an event to happen `--- in part --- as a result of' some other event.
  Roughly, it was not possible for \(\ed{}\) to happen without \(\ed{\flat}\) happening.
  In this respect, \(\ed{}\) only happened --- in part --- as a result \(\ed{\flat}\).%
  \footnote{
    I suspect `causally depends on' may be substituted in place of `happens --- in part --- as a result of'.

    For example, if \(\ed{}\) causally depends on \(\ed{\flat}\) \emph{just in case} \(\ed{}\) would not occur were \(\ed{\flat}\) not occur (\cite[cf.][1.1]{Menzies:2020aa}), then the agent buttering toast causally depends on the bread being toasted.

    However, in contrast to an event being --- in part --- the result of some other event I doubt there is much pre-theoretical intuition for what causal dependence amounts to.

    A number of Aesop's fable, in translation at least, talk about events being results of other events and I have not found a (translation of a) fable that talks about causal dependence.
    E.g.:
    %
    \begin{quote}
      A deer had fallen ill and was resting on the grassy plain.
      When the other animals came to see her, they ate up all the grass in her pasture.
      As a result, when the deer recovered from her illness, she ended up dying since her pasture had come to an end.%
      \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[124]{Aesop:2002aa})}
    \end{quote}
    %
    Still, Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} requires \(\ed{}\) is in progress, and if the progressive is understood via causation as suggested, e.g. \textcite{Szabo:2004ul}, then both clauses may then be expressed via causation.
  }

  For example, it is not possible for an agent to be paddling in the ocean unless the agent steps foot into the ocean.
  Hence, the agent paddling in the ocean happened --- in part --- as the result of the agent stepping foot into the ocean.

  Likewise, it is not possible for an agent to butter some toast without some bread being toasted.
  Hence, the agent buttering toast happened --- in part --- as a result of the bread being toasted.

  The following two observations (\ref{obs:se-need-hCon} and \ref{obs:theEventsHuh})  and proposition highlight important features of Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:hCon}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  First, observe \(\ed{}\) happening --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\) does not follow from \(\ed{\flat}\) being such that an event \(\ed{}\) is in progress:

  \begin{observation}[Irrelevant progress]%
    \label{obs:se-need-hCon}%
    It may be the case that:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\ed{\flat}\) is such that an event \(\ed{}\) is in progress and \(\ed{}\) happens.
    \item
      \(\ed{}\) does not happen --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{obs:se-need-hCon}
    Suppose an agent is passing an exam without external help.
    Then, a classmate passes the agent some answers, which the agent uses.
    The agent passes the exam, and was passing an exam without external help but the agent does not pass the exam as a result passing an exam without external help.
  \end{motivation}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Second, observe \(\ed{}\) happening --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\) concerns \(\edn{}\) under description \(\edo{}\) and \(\edn{\flat}\) under description \(\edo{\flat}\).
  These descriptions capture features of the relevant events, and so of interest is whether the features of \(\edn{}\) as captured by description \(\edo{}\) happened --- in part --- as a result of the feature of \(\edn{\flat}\) as captured by description \(\edo{\flat}\).
  This brief observation has the important consequence:

  \begin{proposition}[Limited descriptions]
    \label{prop:se-d-lim}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \(\ed{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \(\edo{\flat}\) does not include features of \(\edn{\flat}\) that \(\ed{}\) does not happen as a result of.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:se-d-lim}
    As highlighted above, our interest is in whether \(\edn{}\) as described by \(\edo{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\edn{\flat}\) as described by \(\edo{\flat}\).

    Our interest is \emph{not} with whether \(\edn{}\) as described by \(\edo{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\edn{\flat}\) as described by \emph{some part of} \(\edo{\flat}\).

    In this respect, \(\ed{}\) must be a result of everything captured by \(\edo{\flat}\).
  \end{argument}

  \noindent%
  For example, suppose \(\edo{}\) is the description `an agent shuffles a deck so that \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{} by sleight of hand', and \(\edo{}\) is true of \(\edn{}\).
  Further, suppose \(\edo{\flat}\) is the description `the agent marks the \mainCard{} so they do not lose the card in a shuffle' and \(\edo{\flat}\) is true of \(\edn{\flat}\).

  Now, intuitively \(\ed{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
  For, \(\ed{\flat}\) captures part of the sleight of hand.
  It is not possible for the agent to shuffle a deck so that \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{} by sleight of hand without ensuring they do not lose \mainCard{} in the shuffle.%
  \footnote{
    Of course, the agent may randomly shuffle a deck so that \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{}, but then the agent has not shuffled a deck \emph{so that} \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{}.
  }

  However, \(\edo{\flat}\) may be expanded to include further details.
  For example, let \(\edo{\flat +}\) be the description `the agent marks the \mainCard{} so they do not lose the card in a shuffle while finding a hole in their sock'.
  Intuitively, it is not the case that \(\ed{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat +}\).
  For, the agent finding a hole in their sock had no influence on whether the agent marked \mainCard{}.

  Though, if \(\edn{}\) is described by \(\edo{+}\) as shuffles the deck by performing sleight of hand while coming to regret not buying a new pair of socks in the January sale, then \(\ed{+}\) plausibly happens as a result of \(\ed{\flat +}\).
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Finally, our interest is not with whether \emph{any} event captured by description \(\edo{}\) is a result of any event captured by description \(\edo{\flat}\).
  In particular, features of \(\edn{}\) which are not captured by \(\edo{}\) and features of \(\edn{\flat}\) which are not captured by \(\edo{\flat}\) may be relevant to \(\ed{}\) happening --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
  This is highlighted by the following observation:

  \begin{observation}
    \label{obs:theEventsHuh}
    It may be the case that \(\ed{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\) only given details of \(\edn{}\) and \(\edn{\flat}\) which are not captured by \(\edo{}\) and \(\edo{\flat}\).
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{obs:theEventsHuh}
    Consider the example following \autoref{prop:se-d-lim}.

    \(\edo{}\) is the description `an agent shuffles a deck so that \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{} by sleight of hand', and \(\edo{}\) is true of \(\edn{}\).
    And, \(\edo{\flat}\) is the description `the agent marks the \mainCard{} so they do not lose the card in a shuffle' and \(\edo{\flat}\) is true of \(\edn{\flat}\).

    \(\ed{}\) intuitively happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
    However, \(\edo{\flat}\) does not guarantee that the agent successfully completes the shuffle.
    For example, it is consistent with \(\edo{\flat}\) that the agent loses their mark.
    Still, the implicit understanding of \(\edn{}\) and \(\edn{\flat}\) is that the two shuffles are connected.
    And, so long as the two shuffles are connected \(\ed{}\) plausibly does happen --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\) for the motivated given above.
  \end{motivation}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \autoref{obs:theEventsHuh} may be seen to pair with \autoref{prop:se-d-lim}.
  For, our interest is in whether \(\edn{}\) as described by \(\edo{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\edn{\flat}\) as described by \(\edo{\flat}\).
  This means that everything in the description \(\edo{\flat}\) must be relevant to whether \(\edn{}\) as described by \(\edo{}\) happens.
  However, this does not means that everything relevant to whether \(\edn{}\) as described by \(\edo{}\) happens is captured by \(\edo{\flat}\).
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  In short, I take the idea \(\ed{}\) happening --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\) to be intuitive.

  Our interest is in the feature of \(\edn{}\) captured by description \(\edo{}\) being --- in part --- a result of the feature of \(\edn{\flat}\) captured by description \(\edo{\flat}\).
  Hence, \(\edo{\flat}\) is limited to what is relevant to \(\edn{}\) as captured by description \(\edo{}\) happening (\autoref{prop:se-d-lim}) though \(\edo{\flat}\) need not exhaust what is relevant to \(\edn{}\) as captured by description \(\edo{}\) happening (\autoref{obs:theEventsHuh}).
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  To close this section we provide an argument for \se{} with respect to \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.

  \begin{application}[A \se{} of \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}]
    \label{obs:se-inst}%
    Given:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(\edn{}\) is the event described by \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.
    \item
      \(\Phi\) captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation prior to \(\edn{}\).
    \item
      \(\edo{}\) is the description `the agent concludes \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\)'.
    \item
      \(\edn{\flat}\) covers Step~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor} of the \agents{} reasoning in \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}
    \end{itemize}
    %
    It is the case that:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There is some description \(\edo{\flat}\) such that \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{application}

  \begin{dets}{obs:se-inst}
    \color{blue}
    Let \(\edn{\flat}\) be the event which covers Step~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor} of the \agents{} reasoning in \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.

    \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F} describes \(\edn{\flat}\) as an event in which the agent is attempting to find possible values for \(x\) such that \(2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0\) and figures out \((2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\).
    I take it to be sufficiently clear that the agent \emph{is} (regardless of any description) concluding \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\) in \(\edn{\flat}\).
    Therefore, we fix a description \(\edo{\flat}\) of \(\edn{\flat}\) which states; `the agent is concluding \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\) in \(\edn{\flat}\) and figures out \((2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\)'.%
    \footnote{
      We have fixed a description such that clauses~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} and \ref{assu:p:se:hCon} are mostly immediate.
      This is in keeping with the spirit of \autoref{def:se}.
      For, the role of \(d'\) is to avoid capturing irrelevant details of \(\edn{}\) --- e.g.\ that the agent concludes \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\) without furrowing their brow.
    }
    \medskip

    Okay, there's a trick here.
    We're interested in a specific event \(\edn{}\).
    This is not any event \(\edn{\sharp}\) such that \(\edo{}\) is true of \(\edn{\sharp}\).
    Hence, though we want to show \(\edn{}\) under description \(\edo{}\) happens as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\), we may still appeal to certain features of \(\edn{}\) which are not captured by \(\edo{}\).

    For our purposes, \(\edn{}\) is that there is no event after \(\edn{\flat}\) in which the agent re-figures out \((2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\).%
    \footnote{
      This constraint is motivated by the observation that the agent may do Step~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor}, be interrupted, discard the result and then factor \(2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0\) again.
      In this case, Step~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor:done} plausibly need not happen as a result of Step~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor}.
      This does not follow from \(\edo{\flat}\) alone.
      An event in which the agent concludes \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\) is in progress (cf.\ \autoref{def:es-in-prog}) and by \assuPP{} possible event.
      However, \dots
    }

    The argument is by contradiction.

    Suppose \(\edn{}\) does not happen as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
    This is a contradiction.

    For, by supposition \(\edn{}\) does not happen as a result of an event in which the agent figures out \((2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\).
    And, \(\edn{}\) is an event in which the agent concludes \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from a \pool{} of premises which captures their understanding of factorisation.
    Yet, as the agent did not conclude by factoring \(2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0\), it cannot be the case that the \agents{} concluded by their understanding of factorisation.
    The agent must have concluded \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} by some other \pool{}.
    \medskip

    So, the proposition.
    This is satisfied.
    Does happen as a result of figuring out.

  \end{dets}

  \noindent%
  The key idea of \autoref{obs:se-inst} is somewhat straightforward:
  Observe it makes no sense for \(\edo{}\) to be true of \(\edn{}\) if it is not the case that \(\ed{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\edo{\flat}\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\).
\end{note}



\subsection{\progEx{2}}
\label{sec:ProgEx}


\begin{note}
  An observation about events in progress an explanations about why an event happened --- given the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.

  Recall, in particular, we understand the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{} in terms of why did the event \(\ed{}\) in which an agent concludes some \prop{0} \(\phi\) has \val{0} \(v\) from some \pool{0} \(\Phi\) happen, rather than any incompatible event --- e.g., an event in which the agent failed to conclude \(\phi\) has \val{0} \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}



\paragraph*{\progExI{}}


\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}[\progExI{}]%
    \label{prop:PEbasic}%
    Given \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} does \(a\):

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
    \item[\emph{Then:}]
      \(\edo{\flat}\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened, in the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  % \noindent%
  % The argument for \autoref{prop:PEbasic} primarily follows from the way in which we understand the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}, the definition of a \se{} (\autoref{def:se}) and our assumption that it is not possible for two incompatible events to be in progress (\autoref{assu:p:ex}).

  \begin{motivation}{prop:PEbasic}
    Assume \(\ed{\flat}\) as a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
    \medskip

    \noindent%
    By Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} of \autoref{def:se} (\autopageref{def:se}), \(\ed{\flat}\) is such that \(\ed{}\) is in progress.
    So, by \autoref{assu:p:ex}:
    For any description \(\ed{\ast}\) such that it is not possible for \(\edo{}\) and \(\edo{\ast}\) to both be true of an event, it is not the case that \(\ed[\ast]{}\) is in progress, given .
    So, \(\ed{\flat}\) being such that \(\ed{}\) is in progress favours \(\ed{}\) happening over any other incompatible event (\(\ed[\ast]{}\)) happening.
    \medskip

    \noindent%
    Further, by Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:hCon} of \autoref{def:se}, \(\ed{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
    So, \(\ed{}\) happened --- in part --- as a result of something with favoured \(\ed{}\) happening over any other incompatible event happening.
    \medskip

    \noindent%
    In this respect, \(\edo{\flat}\) being true of \(\ed{}\) explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened, as opposed any other event.
    For, \(\edo{\flat}\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) gets that \(\ed{}\) was favoured over any other (incompatible) event and \(\ed{}\) happened --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
  \end{motivation}

  \noindent%
  In other words, given \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\), \(\edo{\flat}\) being true of \(\ed{}\) explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened in a basic sense, as by Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:hCon} \(\ed{}\) happened --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).
  And, Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} allows us to expand this observation to see \(\ed{}\) happened --- in part --- as a result of something which favoured \(\ed{}\) happening over any (incompatible) event.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  For example, \autoref{obs:se-inst} established the description \(\edo{\flat}\) such that the event \(\edn{\flat}\) which covers Step~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor} of the \agents{} reasoning is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
  Specifically, \(\edo{\flat}\) was `the agent is concluding \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\) in \(\edn{\flat}\) and figures out \((2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\)'
  Hence, by \autoref{prop:PEbasic}, \(\edo{\flat}\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) explains `why' the agent concluded \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\).

  Specifically, given the argument for \autoref{obs:se-inst}, \(\edo{\flat}\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) explains `why' the agent concluded \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\) as the \agents{} conclusion happened as a result of the agent figuring out \((2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\) and as the agent was concluding \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\) while figuring out \((2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\).
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Setting the particular way \progEx{} is motivated aside, I take the basic idea to be intuitive.
  For example, consider \citeauthor{Hempel:1965aa}'s Deductive-Nomological account of scientific explanation:
  \phantlabel{mention:Hempel:1}
  % 
  \begin{quote}
    [A Deductive-Nomological] explanation answers the question
    `\emph{Why} did the explanandum-phenomenon occur?'
    by showing that the phenomenon resulted from certain particular circumstances, specified in \(C_{1}, C_{2}, \dots C_{k}\), in accordance with the laws \(L_{1}, L_{2}, \dots L_{\gamma}\).
    By pointing this out, the argument shows that, given the particular circumstances and the laws in question, the occurrence of the phenomenon \emph{was to be expected}; and it is in this sense that the explanation enables us to \emph{understand why} the phenomenon occurred.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeyear[337]{Hempel:1965aa})}
  \end{quote}
  % 
  Observe, \citeauthor{Hempel:1965aa} stress a connexion with observing an event \textquote{was to be expected} and an explanation allowing us to \textquote{understand why} the event occurred (the italics are \citeauthor{Hempel:1965aa}'s).
  For \citeauthor{Hempel:1965aa} the relevant expectation follows from circumstances and laws while for us the relevant expectation follows from identifying some event such that the event of interest is in progress (and happens --- in part --- as a result of).

  Further, circumstances and laws on the one hand and events in progress on the other hand are plausibly connected.
  For, if some event is due to happen given certain circumstances and laws, then the event is in progress.
  If this entailment holds, then weaker.%
  \footnote{
    Looking ahead, our full method for constructing counterexamples to \issueInclusion{} will appeal to a law-like idea (specifically the idea of an agent \tC{} in \autoref{cha:typical}).
    However, the law-like idea we appeal to is not used to provide additional motivation with respect to what explains.
    Rather, that law-like idea is used to extract additional features of particular descriptions.
  }

\paragraph*{\progExII{}}


\begin{note}
  \progExI{} observes the key way a description of a \se{} of some event explains `why' the event happens.
  However, our interest is with \ros{1}.
  And, that a \ros{1} holds need not be part of the description of a \se{}.

  So, our attention now turns to \progExII{} which expands on \progExI{}, and a consequence of \progExII{} highlights the way \ros{1} may answer \qWhy{}.
  We explicitly highlight the relevant consequence after the statement of and argument for \progExII{}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}[\progExII{}]%
    \label{prop:PEentail}%
    Given \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} does \(a\):

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      There is some \se{} \(\ed{\flat}\) of \(\ed{}\) such that:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        \(\edo{\flat}\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) (non-vacuously) entails feature \(f\) is true of \(\edn{\flat}\).
      \end{itemize}
    \item[\emph{Then:}]
      Feature \(f\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened, in the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-2\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}


  \begin{argument}{prop:PEentail}
    Assume \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\), and feature \(f\) such that \(f\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) is (non-vacuously) entailed by \(\edo{\flat}\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\).

    Now, consider the description which combines of \(\edo{\flat}\) and \(f\): \(\edo{\flat + f}\).
    We claim \(\edo{\flat + f}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\), and then argue \(f\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) alone explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened, in the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.
    \medskip

    To see that \(\ed[\flat + f]{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\), we check both clauses of \autoref{def:se} are satisfied:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:prog} is satisfied.

      For, by assumption \(\ed{\flat}\) is such that \(\ed{}\) is in progress.
      So, as \(\edo{\flat + f}\) combines \(\edo{\flat}\) and \(f\), \(\ed[\flat + f]{\flat}\) must be such that \(\ed{}\) is in progress
    \item
      Clause~\ref{assu:p:se:hCon} is satisfied.

      For, \(f\) is (non-vacuously) entailed by \(\edo{\flat}\).
      So, \(\edo{\flat + f}\) captures no more of \(\edn{\flat}\) than \(\edo{\flat}\) implicitly captures.
      Hence, as \(\ed{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\), it must be the case that \(\ed{}\) happens --- in part --- as a result of \(\ed[\flat + f]{\flat}\).
    \end{itemize}
    %
    So, \(\ed[\flat + f]{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
    \medskip

    Now, as \(\ed[\flat + f]{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\) it follows by \autoref{prop:PEbasic} that \(\edo[\flat + f]{\flat}\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened, in the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.

    Finally, observe that for some thing to explain `why' \(\ed{}\) happened, given the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}, the thing need not amount to a complete explanation of `why' \(\ed{}\) happened.
    Hence, and particular part of \(\edo[\flat + f]{\flat}\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened, and specifically \(f\) being true of \(\edn{\flat}\) explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened.
  \end{argument}

  Given \autoref{prop:PEentail}, if \(\edo{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\), then any part of \(\edo{\flat}\) explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened.
  Hence, given \autoref{obs:se-inst} the agent figuring out \((2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\) explains why the agent concluded \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{0} \valI{True} from \(\Phi\) in \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.
\end{note}



\paragraph*{\progEx{2} and \ros{1}}


\begin{note}
  An simple consequence of \autoref{prop:PEentail} clarifies the way we obtain answers to \qWhy{}:

  \begin{proposition}[\progEx{2}, conclusions, and \ros{1}]%
    \label{sketch:PE:cROS}%
    Given \(\ed{}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\):

    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      Conditions \ref{sketch:PE:cROS:a} and \ref{sketch:PE:cROS:a} both hold:
      %
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=\arabic*]
      \item
        \label{sketch:PE:cROS:a}
        \(\ed{}\) is an event in which agent concludes \(\phi\) has \val{0} \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
      \item
        \label{sketch:PE:cROS:b}
        There is some \se{} \(\ed{\flat}\) of \(\ed{}\) such that:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item
          \(\edo{\flat}\) entails it is true of \(\edn{\flat}\) that:
          A \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\) and \(\Psi\) holds throughout \(\ed{\flat}\).
        \end{itemize}
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then:}]
      The \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{sketch:PE:cROS}
    Assume conditions \ref{sketch:PE:cROS:a} and \ref{sketch:PE:cROS:b} hold.

    By Condition~\autoref{sketch:PE:cROS:b}, the \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\) and \(\Psi\) holds throughout \(\ed{\flat}\) explains `why' \(\ed{}\) happened, in the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.
    And, by Condition~\autoref{sketch:PE:cROS:a}, \(\ed{}\) just is an event in which agent concludes \(\phi\) has \val{0} \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
    Hence, the \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{}.
  \end{argument}

  \noindent%
  \autoref{sketch:PE:cROS} structures the argument to follow.

  Our first task is to demonstrate a description of some event entails a \ros{} holds.

  Our second task is to show some \se{} of an event in which an agent concludes some \prop{0} \(\phi\) has \val{0} from some \pool{0} \(\Phi\) entails a \ros{} holds.

  And, our third task is to show some \se{} entails a \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\) and \(\Psi\) holds even when an agent has not concluded \(\psi\) has \val{0} \(v'\) from \(\Psi\) when the agent concludes \(\phi\) has \val{0} from \(\Phi\).

  The third step establishes \issueInclusion{} fails to hold.
  For, by \autoref{sketch:PE:cROS} the relevant \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\) and \(\Psi\), and \issueInclusion{} holds only if the agent has concluded \(\psi\) has \val{0} \(v'\) from \(\Psi\) when the agent concludes \(\phi\) has \val{0} from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}





\section*{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

% \subsection{Ex}

% {
% \color{red}
% Here, this example is to be reworked to highlight interesting features of events in progress and \progEx{}.

% Basically, when scoring darts, event in progress through a variety of different things happen.
% Then, as play goes on, this constrains what the agent may do (as the need to score 501).
% E.g. if it's the last throw and the agent has a score of 481, then they need to hit a 20.

% In turn, one the game is over, understand why agent won, as, e.g. they were hitting a 20 on the last throw.
% }

%   \begin{note}
%     \begin{illustration}[Darts]
%       Agent wins at darts just in case there is some action available to the agent, such that if the agent were to perform the action they would be winning at darts.

%       Winning is a complex action.
%       An agent has three dart throws to lower their score from 501 to 0 before play switches to the other player, and play continues until neither player may lower their score further on their next turn (without going past 0).
%       Playing a game is a complex action, as the region of a dartboard an agent wishes to hit changes according to previous throws.
%       For example, if the agent's score is 51 with three throws remaining, the agent will not wish to hit bullseye, as there is no way to reduce their score by a single point using two darts.
%       If the agent goes on to hit 20, then the score of the remaining to darts should equal 31, and so on.
%     \end{illustration}

%     Note, the initial sequence of actions may be more or less arbitrary.
%     It is not possible to score 501 in three or six dart throws, so an agent \emph{could} start by throwing a few darts blindly, so long as they have sufficient skill to recover on subsequent throws.

%     Of course, throwing darts is quite different from concluding, but this note extends.
%     An agent may be concluding a theorem is true even though their first line of enquiry turns out to be a dead end, etc.

%     This is the appeal of the progressive.
