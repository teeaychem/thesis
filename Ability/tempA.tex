\section{\pevent{3}}
\label{sec:assupp2}

\begin{note}
  we noted the progressive allows us to capture conclusions which are available to the agent, but not yet made.
  Though, to identify such conclusions via the progressive it must be the conclusion is in progress.
  Still, with the progressive in hand we may define broader modalities in terms of the progressive.
  In particular, we define a \pevent{} as follows:

  \begin{definition}[\pevent{3}]%
    \label{def:potenital-event}%
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There is a \emph{\pevent{}} in which \vAgent{} does \(X\).
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{If and only if}:


    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There is some action \(a\) such that both~\ref{def:PE:action} and~\ref{def:PE:prog} are true:

      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item
        \label{def:PE:action}
        \(a\) is an action available to \vAgent{}.
      \item
        \label{def:PE:prog}
        An event in which \vAgent{} does \(X\) is in progress when \vAgent{} does \(a\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{definition}

  The role of \pevent{1} is to capture an event which is `possible' in the sense of the progressive without the truth of the progressive.
  Of course, the added modality to move to an event in which the progressive is true, and this modality may be scrutinised.
  Still, I take an `available action' to be sufficiently intuitive.%
  \footnote{
    For background reading, \autoref{def:potenital-event} parallels \citeauthor{Mandelkern:2017aa}'s act conditional analysis of ability, where `practically available' parallels `available' (\citeyear[\S5]{Mandelkern:2017aa}).
    Likewise, consider `options' in \citeauthor{Boylan:2020aa}'s `determinacy' analysis (\citeyear[\S4]{Boylan:2020aa}).
