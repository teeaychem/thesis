\chapter{Claiming support, `use', and two conflicting ideas}
\label{cha:claiming-support-use}

\begin{note}
  Claiming support, seen in previous chapter.
  Basic requirement with respect to `defeaters'.
  Now turn to an intuitive sufficient idea, granting necessary.
  Then, state an idea of a necessary condition.
  And, conflicting sufficient condition.

  Arguing against the idea for a necessary is the rest of this paper.
