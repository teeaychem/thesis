\chapter{\qWhy{} and \qHow{} an agent concludes}
\label{cha:intro}


\begin{note}
  Our interest is understanding the way an event in which an agent concludes happens.

  \begin{scenario}[Calculation]%
    \label{scen:calc}%
    An agent enters `\gistCalcLHS{}' into a calculator and presses a button marked `\(=\)'.
    The calculator displays `\gistCalcRHS{}'.

    The agent pauses for a moment.
    They have a good understanding of arithmetic.
    And, given the display on the calculator, it follows that if the calculator is trustworthy, then they would not fail to conclude \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} via their understanding of arithmetic.

    The agent concludes \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}.
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  Intuitively, the agent concludes \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} from the calculator.
  More could be said about the way the agent concludes but these details won't be of too much interest.%
  \footnote{
    For example, classify the agent as regarding the calculator as a source of testimony, adding that testimony are factive, and so concluded \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} from the testimony of the calculator.
  }

  The agent's understanding of arithmetic, it seems, had no significant role.
  So long as the calculator was correct, the agent had the opportunity to conclude \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} by their understanding of arithmetic, but the agent did not do any arithmetic.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Abstracting a little, \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} corresponds to a way things may be.
  If the truths of mathematics are necessary, then things are always this way.
  Even so, \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} captures a way things may be in the same way as \propI{Foxes change the colour of their fur to reflect their mood} captures a way things may be.
  For ease we refer to ways things may be as \emph{\prop{1}}.

  Continuing the abstraction, when the agent concludes \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, we may say the agent concludes it is true \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} is the way things are.
  Shortening this a little, we say the agent concludes the \prop{} \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has the \emph{\val{}} \valI{True}.

  Intuitively, a \prop{}-\val{} pair captures something about the way things are from an \agpe{}.
  For example, even if \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} never fails to be, the calculator may have been faulty and the agent may have concluded \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has \val{} \valI{False} or \propM{\gistCalcEqBad{}} has \val{} \valI{True}.%
  \footnote{
    Our interest is primarily with the \val{} \valI{True}.
    However, we place no restrictions on possible \val{1}.
    Hence, an agent may conclude \propI{Foxes change the colour of their fur to reflect their mood} has \val{} \valI{Desirable}.
    I.e., the agent concludes it is desirable that Foxes change the colour of their fur to reflect their mood.
  }

  Finally, the agent concluded \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has \val{} \valI{True} from something.
  Specifically, some way things are from the \agpe{}.
  In other words, some collection of \prop{}-\val{} pairs.
  Shortening, we term a collection of \prop{}-\val{} pairs a \emph{\pool{}}.

  What the relevant \pool{} includes is difficult to say.
  Intuitively, the \pool{} involves the agent's interaction with the calculator, rather than the agent's understanding of arithmetic.
  But, what in detailed happened in under-specified by \autoref{scen:calc}.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Abstracting from almost all the details of \autoref{scen:calc} then, we say an agent concluded some \prop{} \(\phi\) has some \val{} \(v\) from some \pool{} \(\Phi\).

  The `\emph{from}' in the previous statement seems to do work.
  A sequence happened in which the agent used the calculator and then concluded \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True}.
  However, in addition to this sequence, something about the calculator led the agent to conclude \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True}.

  Our understanding of \autoref{scen:calc} differs if the agent applied their understanding of arithmetic, or if the agent asked some other person.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Abstracting further, we say something about the calculator \emph{supports} \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} being \valI{True}, \emph{from the \agpe{}}.
  Where, a \ros{} between \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\) abstractly characterises the way in which \(\phi\) having \val{0} \(v\) `follows from' \(\Phi\), from the \agpe{}.

  Speaking in terms of \ros{1} allows abstraction from what happens when an agent concludes.
  A \ros{} holds between \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, \valI{True} and the calculator when the agent concludes \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, \valI{True} from the calculator.
  Still, a \ros{} may also hold between \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, \valI{True} and the \agents{} understanding of arithmetic, though the agent did not conclude from their understanding of arithmetic.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Here's a second, slightly more complex \scen{0}:

  \begin{scenario}[Animalism]%
    \label{scen:animalism}%
    `Four legs good, two legs bad.'
    This, he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism.
    Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences.
    The birds at first objected, since it seemed to them that they also had two legs, but Snowball proved to them that this was not so.

    `A bird's wing, comrades,' he said, `\textsc{is} an organ of propulsion and not of manipulation.
    It should therefore be regarded as a leg.
    The distinguishing mark of Man is the \emph{hand}, the instrument with which he does all his mischief.'

    The birds did not understand Snowball's long words, but they accepted his explanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the new maxim by heart.
    \textsc{four legs good, two legs bad}, was inscribed on the end wall of the barn\dots%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[25]{Orwell:1976aa})}%
    \newline
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  The agents of interest are the birds, and the conclusion is the essential principle of Animalism:
  \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad} has value \valI{True}.

  Snowball provided an argument against an objection from the birds, and the birds concluded \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad} is \valI{True} from Snowball's explanation.

  Though, as \citeauthor{Orwell:1976aa} highlights, the birds did not conclude \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad} from \emph{the content of} Snowball's explanation.
  (Some words were too long.)
  Instead, the birds concluded, at least in part, from (the existence of) \emph{Snowball's explanation}.

  % In parallel to the agent's understanding of arithmetic from~\autoref{scen:calc} the birds of~\autoref{scen:animalism} did not, in part, conclude \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad} from the content of Snowball's explanation.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  In line with the abstraction given, we may say:
  The birds conclude \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad} has value \valI{True} from the existence of Snowball's explanation.
  And, for each bird, a \ros{} holds between \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad}, \valI{True}, and the existence of Snowball's explanation.

    And, \wit{0}.

\section*{\qWhy{}, \qHow{} and \issueInclusion{}}
\label{cha:intro:why-how}


\begin{note}
  % Our interest is understanding the way an event in which some agent concludes some proposition \(\phi\) has some value \(v\) from some \pool{} \(\Phi\) happens.
  \phantlabel{how-and-why-first-mention}%
  With respect to understanding the way an event in which an agent concludes happens we distinguish two questions; `\qWhy{}' and `\qHow{}':

  \begin{question}{questionWhy}{\qWhy{}}
    Given \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Which \ros{} between \prop{1}, \val{1}, and \pool{1} explain \emph{why} \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\)?
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-1.5\baselineskip}
  \end{question}

  \begin{question}{questionHow}{\qHow{}}
    \label{q:how}
    Given \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Which past or present events explain \emph{how} \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\)?
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-1.5\baselineskip}
  \end{question}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \qWhy{} fixes an event, and queries why the event is an event in which an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\) rather than an event in which something incompatible with the conclusion \(\phi\) has value \(v\) for \(\Phi\) happens.
  For example, an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi'}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi'\), takes their dog for a walk, runs a bath, etc.

  \qHow{}, by contrast, queries how the event is an event in which an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\) came about.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  To get a feel for the sense of `why' at issue, consider an event in which a deck of cards is shuffled.

  If the cards are randomly shuffled, then, intuitively, nothing explains \emph{why} \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{} after the shuffle.
  For, if cards are shuffled randomly, then nothing favours \mainCard{} being at any particular position in the pack after the shuffle.

  However, if the shuffler is engaging in sleight of hand there may be an explanation why \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{} after the shuffle.
  At a high level on may say: The shuffler selected \mainCard{} and then performed a `break and shuffle'.
  And, at a lower level, one may expand on the details of a break and shuffle (\cite[cf.][189--190]{Hilliard:1994aa}), and lower still one may detail the break and shuffle the shuffler performed.
  The key to any such explanation is that \mainCard{} was selected, and a break and shuffle ensures the selected card is at the \mainCardPos{} after the shuffle.%
  \footnote{
    A similar observation applies to coin flips.
    For, intuitively nothing explains why a unbiased coin landed heads rather than tails.
    Though, it is hard to bias a coin flip. (\cite{Gelman:2002ww})
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Still, the shuffle explains \emph{how} \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{} after the shuffle, whether random or sleighted.
  For, there is a trace the position of \mainCard{} as it moves through the pack during the shuffle.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Generalising, there is no answer to `why' any random event happened, given the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.
  And, anything one may highlight which favours an event \(e\) happening over any other event \(e'\) answers `why' \(e\) happened, given the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.

  In this respect, if causal determinism holds --- any event is the result of antecedent events together with the laws of nature --- then there is always some answer to `why' the event happened.
  For, the antecedent events and laws of nature ensure no other event may have happened.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  The idea of a shuffler is engaging in sleight of hand suggests determinism.
  However, some thing may answer `why' an event happened without the thing determining that the event happens.

  For example, consider rolling a die.
  As with a random shuffle, intuitively nothing answers `why' an agent rolls a 6 with an unbiased die  --- setting causal determinism aside.
  However, if an agent rolls a 6 with a die biased toward 6 then, the bias of the die favours an event in which any agent rolls a 6.
  Though, an agent may still roll of 1,2,4, etc. with given die with bias towards a 6.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \qWhy{}, specifically, seeks answers to an event in which an agent concludes in the form of \ros{1}.

  In this respect, for a \ros{} to answer \qWhy{}, a \ros{} holds prior to agent's conclusion, and favours the conclusion over some other event.

  We introduced \ros{} with via \autoref{scen:calc} given conclusion.
  However, plausibly prior to the conclusion.
  It's already the case that the agent is concluding \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True} prior to the agent's conclusion that \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True}.

  Like the bias of a biased die.
  As soon as the agent has the result from the calculator, everything is in place.
  As resource-bound agent's, things take a little time.

  But, like bias taking effect, or perhaps a card being shuffled to the top of the deck by sleight of hand, may only be that favours conclusion.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  It need not be the case that a \ros{} answers \qWhy{}.
  For, an agent may conclude, in the same way \mainCard{} being randomly shuffled to \mainCardPos{} happens.
  At least, without placing additional constraints on what a conclusion is.
  %
  \footnote{
    Consider \citeauthor{Anscombe:1957aa}'s (\citeyear{Anscombe:1957aa}) discussion of action `for no particular reason', and consider cases in which the relevant action is a conclusion.
  }

  However, in some cases, seems a \ros{} answers \qWhy{}.
  Prior to the conclusion, calculator and so on.
  Prior to the conclusion, force of Snowball's rhetoric, and so on.

  Conclusion as the result of something which favoured conclusion.

  Conclusion is a result of \ros{} holding, from the \agpe{}.

  \ros{} prior to conclusion.
  This is like bias on a die.
  No guarantee but favours event in which agent concludes.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  So, \qWhy{} and \qHow{} are plausibly distinct questions.
  Still, in the case of \qWhy{} and \qHow{} the following constraint on answers to \qWhy{} in terms of answers to \qHow{} seems intuitive:

  \begin{constraint}{consInclusion}{\issueInclusion{}}
    \mbox{ }
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      A \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      An event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\) answers \qHow{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{constraint}

  \noindent%
  In short, for any \ros{} between a \prop{0}, \val{0}, and \pool{} which grants some understanding of the way an agent concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\), there is an event such that the agent concludes the \prop{} has the \val{} from the \pool{}.%
  \footnote{
    What happened does not entail a corresponding \ros{}.
    For example, in \autoref{scen:calc} the agent presses a button marked `\(=\)'.
    However, the agent does not conclude \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True} \emph{from} pressing the button marked `\(=\)'.
    Hence, no \ros{} seems to hold between \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, \valI{True}, and the pressing the button marked `\(=\)'.
  }
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \color{blue}
  Consider the die case.
  Intuitively, it needs to be the case that the bias of the die does something.

  If the die is dropped directly down from a short distance, then no room for bias to do any work.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  In other cases, no \ros{}.
  For example, second \scen{}.
  Don't understand the content of Snowball's explanation.

  Less clear that other \ros{} matter.
  For example, initial \scen{}.
  Arithmetic.

  In other words, a \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) may hold when an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\), as the agent does not conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\), this \ros{} is irrelevant to why the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}



\begin{note}
  \scen{3}~\ref{scen:calc}~and~\ref{scen:animalism} suggest \issueInclusion{} holds:
  %
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item
    With respect to~\autoref{scen:calc}, the only answer to \qWhy{} seems to be the \ros{} between \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, \valI{True}, and something about the calculator.
    And, the agent concludes \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True} from the calculator.
    Hence, there is a corresponding answer to \qHow{}.

    A \ros{} may hold between \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, \valI{True} and whatever \pool{} would be associated with the agent calculating \gistCalcEq{} from their understanding of arithmetic.
    However, there is no event in which the agent concludes \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, has value \valI{True} by doing arithmetic.
    So, there is no answer to \qHow{} with respect to the agent's understanding of arithmetic, and given \issueInclusion{}, it is not possible for a \ros{} to answer \qWhy{}.
  \item
    With respect to~\autoref{scen:animalism}, the only answer to \qWhy{} seems to be the \ros{} between \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad}, \valI{True} and something about the existence of Snowball's explanation.
    And, the birds conclude \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad} has value \valI{True} from the existence of Snowball's explanation.

    As the birds did not understand the content of Snowball's explanation, it seems implausible that a \ros{} held between \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad}, \valI{True}, and the content of Snowball's explanation.
    Still, as there is no event in which the birds conclude \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad} has value \valI{True} from the content of Snowball's explanation, and no such \ros{} may answer \qWhy{} if \issueInclusion{} holds.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \issueInclusion{} seems plausible, and seems to do work.%
  \footnote{
    Note, \qHow{} does not explicitly require the relevant event to be the event in which the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
    Hence, a previous event in which the agent concluded \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True} may answer \qHow{}.
    Still, given \gistCalcEq{} in~\autoref{scen:calc} functions as some arbitrary multiplication that the agent may calculation, we may assume the agent has never calculated \gistCalcEq{}.
  }\(^{,}\)%
  \footnote{
    Alternatively, \issueInclusion{} may be thought to narrow the range on answers to \qWhy{}.
    That is to say, \issueInclusion{} functions to disambiguate the sense of `why' used in the statement of \qWhy{}.
    If so, then \issueInclusion{} is not a constraint, it is simply part of the way \qWhy{} is understood.
    However, I think the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{} may be understood without reference to \issueInclusion{}, and hence that \issueInclusion{} amounts to a substantive constraint.
    The document will assume this is the case, but only framing depends on this.
  }

  Still, we have only considered two \scen{1} and \issueInclusion{} is a general constraint.
  Hence, if there is some doubt regarding \issueInclusion{} then further argument is required.
  It is not obvious that there are \scen{1} in which \issueInclusion{} fails to hold.
  However, lack of apparent counterexamples is no argument.

  Though I would like to consider an argument for \issueInclusion{}, I am not aware of any.%
  \footnote{
    The construction of \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{} is somewhat idiosyncratic, and so it is no surprise there are no direct argument for \issueInclusion{}.
    However, I take the idea captured by \issueInclusion{} to be intuitive, and I am not aware of any argument for this idea either.
  }
  Perhaps \issueInclusion{} is sufficiently intuitive that it is taken for granted.
  Perhaps the failure of \issueInclusion{} is recognised and I have yet to stumble upon the acknowledgement of its failure.
  Or, perhaps this constraint isn't of significant interest.

  I think \scen{1}~\ref{scen:calc}~and~\ref{scen:animalism} intuitively motivate \issueInclusion{}.
  For, consider the following observation:

  \begin{observation}[Counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}]%
    \label{obs:iIceRestriction}%
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      A \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) is a counterexample to \issueInclusion{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      The \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\):
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Answers \qWhy{}.
      \item
        Either \(\psi\) is distinct from \(\phi\), \(v'\) is distinct from \(v\), or \(\Psi\) is distinct from \(\Phi\).
      \item
        There is no prior or present event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-1.5\baselineskip}
  \end{observation}
  %
  \begin{motivation}{obs:iIceRestriction}
    \color{blue}
    Suppose a \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) is a counterexample to \issueInclusion{}.

    \issueInclusion{} constrains answers to \qWhy{} in terms of answers to \qHow{}.
    So, for the \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) to be a counterexample to \issueInclusion{}, the \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) must answer \qWhy{}.

    Further, \qWhy{} applies to events in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    So, the agent has \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\).

    Hence, if \(\psi\) is identical to \(\phi\), \(v'\) is identical to \(v\), and \(\Psi\) is identical to \(\Phi\), the agent has a \wit{} for a a \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\).
    This is compatible with \issueInclusion{}.

    Likewise if there is a prior or present event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\) then the agent has a \wit{} for a \ros{} between \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\).
    This is compatible with \issueInclusion{}.
  \end{motivation}

  \noindent%
  \autoref{obs:iIceRestriction} neatly combines with the intuition that the only \ros{1} which answer \qWhy{} with respect to \scen{1}~\ref{scen:calc}~and~\ref{scen:animalism} are, respectively:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \ros{} between \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, \valI{True}, and something about the calculator.
  \item
    The \ros{} between \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad}, \valI{True} and something about the existence of Snowball's explanation.
  \end{itemize}
  %
  Indeed, an implicit acceptance of \issueInclusion{} may motivate the given intuitions.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  No argument for \issueInclusion{} will be given.
  The goal of this document is to provide a recipe for generating counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.

  By `recipe', I mean an description of some features which hold of \scen{1} and an account of the way in which these combine which entails violations of \issueInclusion{}.
  With the recipe in hand, we will construct a few counter samples, but our interest is with the way in which \issueInclusion{} fails, rather than the failure of \issueInclusion{}.

  In other words, the goal of this document is to show that any \scen{0} which satisfies a collection of features deductively entails \issueInclusion{} does not hold.
  This means definitions, and propositions which extract features from definitions and propositions which link definitions together.%
  \footnote{
    More carefully put, the goal is to establish a collection of features \emph{more-or-less} deductively entails \issueInclusion{} does not hold.
    Some propositions (I think three) fall short of being deductive.
    Though, there is an important distinction between definitions and propositions and the motivation for definitions and propositions.
    I do not claim the relevant motivation is (more-or-less) deductive.
  }

  % \begin{scenario}[Multiplication]%
  %   \label{scen:calc:var}%
  %   An agent enters `\gistCalcLHS{}' into a calculator and presses a button marked `\(=\)'.
  %   The calculator displays `\gistCalcRHS{}'.

  %   The agent pauses for a moment.
  %   They have a good understanding of arithmetic.
  %   And, given the display on the calculator, it follows that if the calculator is trustworthy, then they would not fail to conclude \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} via their understanding of arithmetic.

  %   The agent does the arithmetic and concludes \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}.
  % \end{scenario}

  % \noindent%
  % \autoref{scen:calc:var} is a variation of \autoref{scen:calc} where the agent does arithmetic.

  % Now, suggest that \ros{} holds between the agent's understanding of arithmetic and various other equations.

  % Do any of these \ros{} answer \qWhy{}?
  % Of course, understanding of arithmetic, but are \ros{} required for this?
  % I don't think this is obvious.
  % For example, if reasoning is rule governed,%
  % \footnote{
  %   See, for example, \textcite{Boghossian:2008vf} and \textcite{Broome:2013aa}.
  % }
  % then it seems sufficient to observe the agent followed the relevant rule.


  % Likewise, variation of \autoref{scen:animalism} where the birds understand Snowball's long words but are swayed by Snowball's rhetoric.
  % A \ros{} may hold, but seems irrelevant.
\end{note}



\section*{Counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}}


\begin{note}
  The goal is to provide a recipe for constructing counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
  Specifically, the recipe identifies \scen{1} with three key features:
  %
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    An event \(e\) in which an agent \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
  \item
    A \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) such that:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      There is no prior or present event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\).
    \item
      The \ros{} explains \emph{why} \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  %
  And, from \autoref{obs:iIceRestriction}, we have established either \(\psi\) is distinct from \(\phi\), \(v'\) is distinct from \(v\), or \(\Psi\) is distinct from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  This document has three parts.
  \begin{TOCEnum}
  \item
    % \autoref{part:prep} (\nameref{part:prep})

    Before constructing counterexamples to \issueInclusion{} we detail key ideas introduced in this introduction.

    In particular, we detail the way in which we understand an event in which an agent concludes, and \ros{1}.
    And, we provide a precise account of answers to \qWhy{} and \qHow{}.

    The details are important.
    For, without a sufficiently detailed account of the phenomena of interest, any recipe proposed with fail to identify \scen{1}.
    And, without a detailed account of \qWhy{} and \qHow{} it is unclear whether any identified \scen{1} is a counterexample to \issueInclusion{}.

    Strictly, then, the main argument focuses on \emph{variations} of \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{}.
    We argue any counterexample to the variation of \issueInclusion{} is a counterexample to \issueInclusion{} itself.
    Whether this argument holds depends on the way in which you understand `why' and `how', though whether the recipe constructs counterexamples to the variation of \issueInclusion{} should be clear for you to evaluate.

    % \autoref{part:ing}: (\nameref{part:ing})

    To construct counterexamples to \issueInclusion{} we require a \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) such that there is no prior or present event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\).

    The idea of a \fc{} is used to identify candidate \ros{}.

    And, the \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) also explains \emph{why} \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\).

    To link \ros{1} obtained from \fc{1} to answers to \qWhy{} we introduce two ideas.
    First, the idea of an agent \tCV{}, and second the idea of a \requ{}.

    \requ{3} are the key link between \ros{} and answers to \qWhy{}, and whether an agent is \tCV{} \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\) is used to motivate the existence of \requ{1}.

    Still, \fc{1}, an agent \tCV{0}, and the idea of a \requ{} do not (individually or collectively) entail counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}, these ingredients must be combined in the right way to obtain the desired counterexamples.
    Hence, these ingredients are introduced and motivated without presupposing counterexamples to \issueInclusion{} exist.
  \item
    % \autoref{part:dir} (\nameref{part:dir})

    The final part details the way in which \fc{1}, an agent \tCV{0}, and \requ{} combine with respect to particular events to obtain counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.
    A handful of counter-samples are given, and a few remaining issues are considered.

\section*{Notes}


\begin{note}
  Quick notes:

  First, I hold explanatory reasons are factive, and I think that answers to \qWhy{} reduce to psychological facts of an agent, specifically psychological facts which hold of the agent when they conclude.%
  % \footnote{
  %   This is in slight tension with views of reasons explanation advanced by~(\cite{Dancy:2000aa}) and~(\cite{Alvarez:2013aa}), in which the state of affairs may be an agent's reason (and not just the evaluation of some state of affairs).
  %   Though, the argument will not depend on assuming that the relations reduce to psychological facts.

  %   See~(\cite[413--418]{Hieronymi:2011aa}),~(\cite[3--5]{DOro:2013vh}), and~(\cite[\S2]{Alvarez:2017aa}) for more.
  % }

  Given what I hold and think, from a very broad perspective, \issueInclusion{} is a restriction on which psychological facts of an agent matter when an agent concludes:

  If \issueInclusion{} holds, the only facts which matter are those which secure the \ros{} between \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\).

  And, if \issueInclusion{} fails, facts other than those which secure the \ros{} between \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\) matter, specifically, facts which secure some \ros{} between \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   As seen above with respect to \autoref{scen:animalism}, it follows from \issueInclusion{} that the content of Snowball's explanation is irrelevant.
%   For, the birds do not understand Snowball's explanation, hence there is no event in which the birds reason from the content to \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad} has value \valI{True}.
%   And, I think this is correct.

%   However, parallel reasoning entails the agent's understanding of arithmetic is irrelevant with respect to \autoref{scen:calc}.
%   And, I do not think this entailment holds.
%   I think it may be the case that a relation between \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, \valI{True} and the agent's understanding of arithmetic \emph{may} answer \qWhy{}.
%   Whether this is the case will depend on whether some additional details hold of~\autoref{scen:calc}.
%   Still, as the details matter, the entailment, and hence \issueInclusion{}, is not right.
% \end{note}

\begin{note}
  Still, there is distinction between psychological facts and the exercise of agency.
  To illustrate, there a senses in which the following two questions are distinct:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{Why} is \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\)?
  \item
    \emph{Why} is it the case \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) in \(e\)?
  \end{itemize}

  Consider \citeauthor{Davidson:1973vd}'s climber:
  %
  \begin{quote}
    A climber might want to rid himself of the weight and danger of holding another man on a rope, and he might know that by loosening his hold on the rope he could rid himself of the weight and danger.
    This belief and want might so unnerve him as to cause him to loosen his hold, and yet it might be the case that he never chose to loosen his hold, nor did he do it intentionally.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor[79]{Davidson:1973vd})}
  \end{quote}
  %
  The \agents{} belief and want are psychological facts about the agent, and answer why \emph{the event} is an event in which the agent loosens their hold on the rope.
  However, the \agents{} belief and want do not answer why \emph{the agent} loosens their hold on the rope.
  Indeed, there seems no answer to why the agent loosens their hold on the rope --- the act was not an exercise of agency.

  \citeauthor{Davidson:1973vd}'s climber does not conclude.
  Still, if an agent may loosen their grip without exercising their agency, it is seems plausible that a \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\) and \(\Psi\) which answers why is \emph{\(e\) is an event} in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) may fail to answer why is it the case the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) in \(e\).

  In short, it is not clear that any counterexample to \issueInclusion{} relates to an exercise of agency.
  Whether this matters is for you to decide.
  On some days I think this matters a great deal, and on other days I doubt there is any coherent idea of what an exercise of agency amounts to.

  We set concerns about agency aside for the argument against \issueInclusion{}, and then motivate that relevant counterexamples either involve agency or have nearby neighbours which involve agency.

%     Sometimes the explanation of why a person does something has a particular character:
%     roughly, it involves the person's rationality in a distinctive way that I shall not try to describe.
%     Then we say the person does what she does for a reason.
%     We might say ‘The reason for which Hannibal used elephants was to terrorize the Romans'.
%     The reason for which a person does something is called a ‘motivating reason'.
%     In general, a motivating reason is whatever explains or helps to explain what a person does in the distinctive way that involves her rationality.

%     \emph{R} is a primary reason why an agent performed the action \emph{A} under the description \emph{d} only if \emph{R} consists of a pro attitude of the agent toward actions with a certain property, and a belief of the agent that \emph{A}, under the description \emph{d}, has that property.\newline

%   What matters is the belief.
%   This is the relevant proposition-value pair.
