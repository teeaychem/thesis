\chapter{\qWhy{} and \qHow{} an agent concludes}
\label{cha:intro}


\begin{note}
  Our interest is understanding the way an event in which an agent concludes happens.

  \begin{scenario}[Quadratic roots --- Factors]%
    \label{illu:gist:roots:F}%
    An agent reasons as follows:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:F:eq}
      For some \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), \(2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0\).
      \label{illu:gist:roots:F:factor}
      \((2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0\).% \hfill \ref{illu:gist:roots:F:eq}, Factoring
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:F:zero}
      Either \((2x + 1) = 0\) or \((x - 1) = 0\).% \hfill \ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor}, Arithmetic
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:F:case:a}
      If \((x - 1) = 0\), then \(x = 1\).% \hfill \ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor}, \ref{illu:gist:roots:F:zero}, Arithmetic
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:F:case:b}
      If \((2x + 1) = 0\), then \(x = -\sfrac{1}{2}\).% \hfill \ref{illu:gist:roots:F:factor}, \ref{illu:gist:roots:F:zero}, Arithmetic
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:F:factor:done}
      Either \(x = 1\) or \(x = -\sfrac{1}{2}\).% \hfill \ref{illu:gist:roots:F:zero}, \ref{illu:gist:roots:F:case:a}, \ref{illu:gist:roots:F:case:b}, Replacement
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    The agent concludes:
    \rootsCon{}.%
    \footnote{
      A little more precisely \rootsConFull{}.
    }
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  Intuitively, the agent concludes \propI{\rootsCon{}} from their understanding of factorisation.
  In particular, the \agents{} understanding of the quadratic formula, it seems, is irrelevant to the \agents{} reasoning.
  For example, consider the following \scen{0}:

  \begin{scenario}[Quadratic roots --- Formula]%
    \label{illu:gist:roots:QF}%
    An agent reasons as follows:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=(\arabic*)]
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:QF:eq}
      For some \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), \(2x^{2} - x - 1 = 0\).
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:QF:qf}
      The quadratic formula states \(x = \sfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}\).% \hfill Memory
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:QF:subs}
      Let \(a \coloneq 2\), \(b \coloneq -1\), and \(c \coloneq -1\).% \hfill \ref{illu:gist:roots:QF:eq}, How to use the quadratic formula%
      \footnote{
        \(a\) is the coefficient of the \(x^{2}\) term, \(b\) is the coefficient of the x term, and \(c\) is the constant.
      }
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:QF:qf-subs}
      \(x = \sfrac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^{2} - 4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)}\).% \hfill \ref{illu:gist:roots:QF:qf}, \ref{illu:gist:roots:QF:subs}, Substitution
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:QF:qf:1}
      \(x = \sfrac{(1 \pm 3)}{4}\).% \hfill \ref{illu:gist:roots:QF:qf-subs}, Simplification
    \item
      \label{illu:gist:roots:QF:qf:done}
      Either \(x = 1\) or \(x = -\sfrac{1}{2}\).% \hfill \ref{illu:gist:roots:QF:qf:1}, Expansion, Simplification
    \end{enumerate}
    %
    The agent concludes:
    \rootsCon{}.
  \end{scenario}

  \noindent%
  Just as the quadratic formula seems irrelevant to the \agents{} reasoning in \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}, it seems the \agents{} understanding of factorisation is irrelevant to the \agents{} reasoning in \autoref{illu:gist:roots:QF}.
\end{note}



\paragraph*{Abstractions}


\begin{note}
  Abstracting a little, the conclusion of \scen{1}~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F}~and~\ref{illu:gist:roots:QF} --- \propM{\rootsCon{}} --- corresponds to a way things may be.
  If the truths of mathematics are necessary, then things are always this way.
  Even so, \propM{\rootsCon{}} captures a way things may be in the same way as \propI{Foxes change the colour of their fur to reflect their mood} captures a way things may be.
  For ease we refer to ways things may be as \emph{\prop{1}}.

  Continuing the abstraction, we say an \agents{} concludes some \prop{1} has a \val{}.
  For example, \scen{1}~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F}~and~\ref{illu:gist:roots:QF} the agent concludes \propM{\rootsCon{}} has value \valI{True}.
  Colloquially, the agent concludes it is true \propM{\rootsCon{}} is the way things are.%
  \footnote{
    Our interest is primarily with the \val{} \valI{True}.
    However, we place no restrictions on possible \val{1}.
    Hence, an agent may conclude \propI{Foxes change the colour of their fur to reflect their mood} has \val{} \valI{Desirable}.
    I.e., the agent concludes it is desirable that Foxes change the colour of their fur to reflect their mood.
  }
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Intuitively, a \prop{}-\val{} pair captures something about the way things are from an \agpe{}.
  For example, even if \propM{\rootsCon{}} never fails to be, the agent may have concluded \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{} \valI{False} or \propM{\rootsConBad{}} has \val{} \valI{True}.

  Further, an agent concludes \emph{from} some thing.
  For our interests, an agent concludes a \prop{}-\val{} pair from some way things are from the \agpe{}.
  In other words, some collection of \prop{}-\val{} pairs.
  Shortening, we term the collection of \prop{}-\val{} pairs an agent concludes a \prop{}-\val{} pair from a \emph{\pool{}}.

  In general, what the relevant \pool{} includes is difficult to say.
  Though, we may highlight what is or is not captured by the relevant \pool{}.
  For example, with respect to \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}, the \pool{} captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation but does not capture the \agents{} understanding of the quadratic formula.
  And, with respect to \autoref{illu:gist:roots:QF}, the \pool{} captures the \agents{} understanding of the quadratic formula but does not capture the \agents{} understanding of factorisation.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  Abstracting from almost all the details of \scen{1}~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F}~and~\ref{illu:gist:roots:QF}, we say an agent concluded some \prop{} \(\phi\) has some \val{} \(v\) from some \pool{} \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Our primary interest is with a \ros{} between a \prop{} \(\phi\), \val{} \(v\), and \pool{} \(\Phi\).
  Where, a \ros{} between \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\) abstractly characterises the way in which \(\phi\) having \val{0} \(v\) `follows from' \(\Phi\), from the \agpe{}.

  For example, in \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F} the agent concludes \propM{\rootsCon{}} has value \valI{True} from some \pool{} which captures their understanding of arithmetic.
  Hence, a \ros{} between \propM{\rootsCon{}}, \valI{True} and some \pool{} which captures the \agents{} understanding of arithmetic holds, from \agpe{their}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \ros{3} are understood to abstractly capture when a \prop{0}-\val{0} pair `follows from' some \pool{} regardless of whether the \prop{0}-\val{0} pair has `been concluded from' the \pool{}.

  This abstraction is useful for talking about a conclusion in progress.
  For example, in \scen{1}~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F}~and~\ref{illu:gist:roots:QF}, it seems clear at the third step of reasoning the agent is \emph{concluding} \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{} \valI{True} prior to the \agents{} conclusion that \propM{\rootsCon{}} has \val{} \valI{True}.

  For, the agent understands factorisation and the quadratic formula, and by the third step has started to apply their understanding.
  The relevant conclusion requires additional steps, but the agent does not require any novel information to do the steps.

  XXXX

  That a \ros{} holds is follows from the observation that the agent is concluding and no novel information.


  This contrasts to an event in which an agent is concluding there is rain tomorrow by reading the weather forecast.
  May say concluding.
  However, no \ros{} prior, as the agent is awaiting the testimony of the weather forecaster.
\end{note}



\paragraph*{An additional \scen{0}}


\begin{note}
  \ros{3} of interest are not necessarily restricted to the final conclusion.

  \begin{rscenario}{scen:countS}{Countersign}%
    \indent The captain mumbled, ``I come from Miran.''

    The man returned the gambit, grimly.
    ``Miran is early this year.''

    The captain said, ``No earlier than last year.''

    But the man did not step aside.
    He said, ``Who are you?''

    ``Aren't you Fox?''

    ``Do you always answer by asking?''

    The captain took an imperceptibly longer breath, and then said calmly,
    ``I am Han Pritcher, Captain of the Fleet, and member of the Democratic Underground Party.
    Will you let me in?''%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\cite[70]{Asimov:1945aa})}%
    \newline
  \end{rscenario}

  \noindent%
  In the event described by \autoref{scen:countS} Fox concludes \propI{The person I'm talking to is a member of the Democratic Underground Party} has value \valI{True}.
  Pritcher tells Fox the are a fellow member of the party at the end of the \scen{}.
  Still, Fox has already drawn the conclusion when Fox asks `Who are you?' via the sequence of countersigning.
  And, intuitively, Pritcher saying, No earlier than last year' in response to Fox saying `Miran is early this year' explains why the event develop in an event in which Fox concludes Pritcher is a fellow member of the party.

  Consider Pritcher's opening gambit `I come from Miran'.
  The following conditional holds, from \agpe{Fox's}:
  %
  \begin{itenum}
  \item[\emph{If}:]
    They didn't open with `I come from Miran'.
  \item[\emph{Then}:]
    They're not engaging in countersign.
  \end{itenum}
  %
  And, if Fox doesn't think Pritcher is engaging in countersign, it seems clear Fox does not conclude Pritcher a fellow member of the party.
  Hence, phrased in terms of \ros{}, we have:
  \begin{itenum}
  \item[\emph{If}:]
    A \ros{} between \propI{What they said was an appropriate sign}, \valI{True} and some \pool{} \(\Psi\) fails to hold from \agpe{Fox's}.
  \item[\emph{Then}:]
    The event does not develop into an event in which Fox concludes \propI{The person I'm talking to is a member of the Democratic Underground Party} has value \valI{True} from \(\Phi\).
  \end{itenum}
  %
  In contrast to \ref{illu:gist:roots:F} and \ref{illu:gist:roots:QF}, this \ros{} does not hold prior to Pritcher's opening.
  However, this \ros{} does hold prior to Fox's conclusion, as Fox engages in countersign before concluding Pritcher is a member of The Party.
\end{note}



\section*{\qWhy{}, \qHow{} and \issueInclusion{}}
\label{cha:intro:why-how}


\begin{note}
  \phantlabel{how-and-why-first-mention}%
  With respect to understanding the way an event in which an agent concludes happens we distinguish two questions; `\qWhy{}' and `\qHow{}':

  \begin{question}{questionWhy}{\qWhy{}}
    Given \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Which \ros{} between \prop{1}, \val{1}, and \pool{1} explain \emph{why} \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\)?
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-1.5\baselineskip}
  \end{question}

  \begin{question}{questionHow}{\qHow{}}
    \label{q:how}
    Given \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Which past or present events explain \emph{how} \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\)?
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-1.5\baselineskip}
  \end{question}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \qWhy{} fixes an event, and queries why the event is an event in which an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\) rather than an event in which something incompatible with the conclusion \(\phi\) has value \(v\) for \(\Phi\) happens.
  For example, an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi'}{v}\) from \(\Phi\), \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi'\), takes their dog for a walk, runs a bath, etc.

  \qHow{}, by contrast, queries how the event is an event in which an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\) came about.
\end{note}


\paragraph*{`Why'}


\begin{note}
  To get a feel for the sense of `why' at issue, consider an event in which a deck of cards is shuffled.

  If the cards are randomly shuffled, then, intuitively, nothing explains \emph{why} \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{} after the shuffle.
  For, if cards are shuffled randomly, then nothing favours \mainCard{} being at any particular position in the pack after the shuffle.

  However, if the shuffler is engaging in sleight of hand there may be an explanation why \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{} after the shuffle.
  At a high level on may say: The shuffler selected \mainCard{} and then performed a `break and shuffle'.
  And, at a lower level, one may expand on the details of a break and shuffle (\cite[cf.][189--190]{Hilliard:1994aa}), and lower still one may detail the break and shuffle the shuffler performed.
  The key to any such explanation is that \mainCard{} was selected, and a break and shuffle ensures the selected card is at the \mainCardPos{} after the shuffle.%
  \footnote{
    A similar observation applies to coin flips.
    For, intuitively nothing explains why a unbiased coin landed heads rather than tails.
    Though, it is hard to bias a coin flip. (\cite{Gelman:2002ww})
  }
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Still, the shuffle explains \emph{how} \mainCard{} is \mainCardPos{} after the shuffle, whether random or sleighted.
  For, there is a trace the position of \mainCard{} as it moves through the pack during the shuffle.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \nocite{Hoefer:2023aa}
  Generalising, there is no answer to `why' any random event happened, given the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.
  And, anything one may highlight which favours an event \(e\) happening over any other event \(e'\) answers `why' \(e\) happened, given the sense of `why' present in \qWhy{}.

  In this respect, if causal determinism holds --- any event is the result of antecedent events together with the laws of nature --- then there is always some answer to `why' the event happened.
  For, the antecedent events and laws of nature ensure no other event may have happened.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  The idea of a shuffler is engaging in sleight of hand suggests determinism.
  However, some thing may answer `why' an event happened without the thing determining that the event happens.

  For example, consider rolling a die.
  As with a random shuffle, intuitively nothing answers `why' an agent rolls a 6 with an unbiased die  --- setting causal determinism aside.
  However, if an agent rolls a 6 with a die biased toward 6 then, the bias of the die favours an event in which any agent rolls a 6.
  Though, an agent may still roll of 1,2,4, etc. with given die with bias towards a 6.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \qWhy{}, specifically, seeks answers to an event in which an agent concludes in the form of \ros{1}.

  In this respect, for a \ros{} to answer \qWhy{}, a \ros{} holds prior to agent's conclusion, and favours the conclusion over some other event.

  We introduced \ros{} with via \autoref{scen:calc} given conclusion.
  However, plausibly prior to the conclusion.
  It's already the case that the agent is concluding \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True} prior to the agent's conclusion that \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True}.

  Like the bias of a biased die.
  As resource-bound agent's, things take a little time.

  But, like bias taking effect, or perhaps a card being shuffled to the top of the deck by sleight of hand, may only be that favours conclusion.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  It need not be the case that a \ros{} answers \qWhy{}.
  For, an agent may conclude, in the same way \mainCard{} being randomly shuffled to \mainCardPos{} happens.
  At least, without placing additional constraints on what a conclusion is.%
  \footnote{
    Consider, e.g.\ \citeauthor{Anscombe:1957aa}'s (\citeyear{Anscombe:1957aa}) discussion of action `for no particular reason', and ponder whether there may be cases in which the relevant action is a conclusion.
  }

  However, in some cases, seems a \ros{} answers \qWhy{}.

  Conclusion as the result of something which favoured conclusion.

  Conclusion is a result of \ros{} holding, from the \agpe{}.

  \ros{} prior to conclusion.
  This is like bias on a die.
  No guarantee but favours event in which agent concludes.
\end{note}



\paragraph*{A constraint on answers to \qWhy{} in terms of answers to \qHow{}}


\begin{note}
  So, \qWhy{} and \qHow{} are plausibly distinct questions.
  Still, in the case of \qWhy{} and \qHow{} the following constraint on answers to \qWhy{} in terms of answers to \qHow{} seems intuitive:

  \begin{constraint}{consInclusion}{\issueInclusion{}}
    \mbox{ }
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      A \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      An event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\) answers \qHow{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{constraint}

  \noindent%
  In short, for any \ros{} between a \prop{0}, \val{0}, and \pool{} which grants some understanding of the way an agent concluded \(\phi\) has value \(v\), there is an event such that the agent concludes the \prop{} has the \val{} from the \pool{}.%
  \footnote{
    \color{blue}
    What happened does not entail a corresponding \ros{}.
    For example, 
  }

  In other words, a \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) may hold when an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\), as the agent does not conclude \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\), this \ros{} is irrelevant to why the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}



\paragraph*{Motivation for \issueInclusion{}}


\begin{note}
  \color{blue}
  Consider the die case.
  Intuitively, it needs to be the case that the bias of the die does something.

  If the die is dropped directly down from a short distance, then no room for bias to do any work.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \issueInclusion{} always holds for \ros{} that do not hold prior to an agent's conclusion, such as the \ros{} between \propI{What they said was an appropriate sign}, \valI{True} and some \pool{} from \agpe{Fox's} in \autoref{scen:countS}.

  However, \issueInclusion{} is a substantial constraint if a \ros{} may hold prior to a conclusion, such as with \propI{\rootsCon{}}, \valI{True}, and \pool{1} capturing the agents understanding of the quadratic formula or factorisation in \scen{1}~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F}~and~\ref{illu:gist:roots:QF}.

  Still, \scen{1}~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F}~and~\ref{illu:gist:roots:QF} seem to motivate \issueInclusion{}.

  Consider \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}
  A \ros{} between between \propM{\rootsCon{}}, \valI{True}, and a \pool{} which captures the \agents{} understanding of factorisation answers \qWhy{}.

  For, \agents{} understanding of factorisation paired with application of that understanding favoured an event in which the agent concludes \propM{\rootsCon{}} has value \valI{True} from their understanding of factorisation over any other event.

  And, the agent concluded \propM{\rootsCon{}} has value \valI{True} from their understanding of factorisation.
  Hence, there is a corresponding answer to \qHow{}.

  A \ros{} may hold between \propM{\rootsCon{}}, \valI{True} and a \pool{} which captures the \agents{} understanding of the quadratic formula.
  However, the agent did not conclude \propM{\rootsCon{}} has value \valI{True} from their understanding of the quadratic formula.
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  \issueInclusion{} seems plausible, and seems to do work.%
  \footnote{
    Note, \qHow{} does not explicitly require the relevant event to be the event in which the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
    Hence, a previous event in which the agent concluded \propM{\gistCalcEq{}} has value \valI{True} may answer \qHow{}.
  }

  Still, we have only considered a few \scen{1} and \issueInclusion{} is a general constraint.
  Hence, if there is some doubt regarding \issueInclusion{} then further argument is required.
  However, I am not aware of any arguments for \issueInclusion{}.%
  \footnote{
    The construction of \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{} is somewhat idiosyncratic, and so it is no surprise there are no direct argument for \issueInclusion{}.
    However, I take the idea captured by \issueInclusion{} to be intuitive, and I am not aware of any argument for this idea either.

\section*{Counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}}


\begin{note}
  The goal is to provide a recipe for constructing counterexamples to \issueInclusion{}.

  By `recipe', I mean an description of some features which hold of \scen{1} and an account of the way in which these combine which entails violations of \issueInclusion{}.
  With the recipe in hand, we will construct a few counter samples, but our interest is with the way in which \issueInclusion{} fails, rather than the failure of \issueInclusion{}.

  In other words, the goal of this document is to show that any \scen{0} which satisfies a collection of features entails \issueInclusion{} does not hold.
  This means definitions, and propositions which extract features from definitions and propositions which link definitions together.%
  % \footnote{
  %   More carefully put, the goal is to establish a collection of features \emph{more-or-less} deductively entails \issueInclusion{} does not hold.
  %   Some propositions (I think three) fall short of being deductive.
  %   Though, there is an important distinction between definitions and propositions and the motivation for definitions and propositions.
  %   I do not claim the relevant motivation is (more-or-less) deductive.
  % }

  The recipe identifies \scen{1} with the following features:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    An event in which an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\).
  \item
    A \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) such that clauses \ref{reciF:qWhy}, \ref{reciF:distinct}, and \ref{reciF:nHow} hold:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*., ref=\Alph*]
    \item
      \label{reciF:qWhy}
      The \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{}.
    \item
      \label{reciF:distinct}
      Either \(\psi\) is distinct from \(\phi\), \(v'\) is distinct from \(v\), or \(\Psi\) is distinct from \(\Phi\).
    \item
      \label{reciF:nHow}
      There is no prior (or present) event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\).
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{note}


\begin{note}
  The importance of clauses \ref{reciF:qWhy} and \ref{reciF:distinct} follow from the following observation:

    \begin{observation}[Failures to \issueInclusion{}]%
    \label{obs:iIceRestriction}%
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      A \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) is a counterexample to \issueInclusion{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      Conditions \ref{obs:iIceRestriction:why} and \ref{obs:iIceRestriction:distinct} are true of the \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\):
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=\arabic*]
      \item
        \label{obs:iIceRestriction:why}
        The \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{}.
      \item
        \label{obs:iIceRestriction:distinct}
        Either \(\psi\) is distinct from \(\phi\), \(v'\) is distinct from \(v\), or \(\Psi\) is distinct from \(\Phi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-1.5\baselineskip}
  \end{observation}
  %
  \begin{motivation}{obs:iIceRestriction}
    Suppose a \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) is a counterexample to \issueInclusion{}.
    We observe each condition holds.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      \issueInclusion{} constrains answers to \qWhy{} in terms of answers to \qHow{}.
    So, for the \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) to be a counterexample to \issueInclusion{}, the \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\), and \(\Psi\) must answer \qWhy{}.
  \item
    \qWhy{} applies to events in which an agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\).

    Now, if \(\psi\) is the same as \(\phi\), \(v'\) is the same as \(v\), and \(\Psi\) is the same as \(\Phi\) then the event in which the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\) is an event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\).
    And, the event in which the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) from \(\Phi\) answers \qHow{}.
    Hence, an event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\) answers \qHow{}.
  \end{enumerate}
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{motivation}

  \noindent%
  Clause \ref{reciF:nHow} is optional.
  In short, the clause ensures the recipe is compatible with \scen{1} where some prior event in which the agent concludes \(\psi\) has value \(v'\) from \(\Psi\) answers \qHow{}.
  Whether or not there are \scen{1} with this feature is something we set aside.
  I am not sure whether there are such \scen{1} though we do not assume there are no such \scen{1}.

\paragraph*{Structure}


\begin{note}
  Before constructing counterexamples to \issueInclusion{} we detail key ideas introduced in this introduction.

  The details are important.
  For, without a sufficiently detailed account of the phenomena of interest, any recipe proposed with fail to identify \scen{1}.
  And, without a detailed account of \qWhy{} and \qHow{} it is unclear whether any identified \scen{1} is a counterexample to \issueInclusion{}.

  Start with events.
  Clarify \qWhy{}.

  Following, conclusions.
  Little of interest here.

  Key idea with respect to \scen{1}~\ref{illu:gist:roots:F}~and~\ref{illu:gist:roots:QF} is \ros{} prior to conclusion.
  To capture instances, \fc{1}.

  With \fc{1}, \ros{1}.

  With \ros{1}, return to \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{}.

  Counterexamples.
  \requ{2}.
  \fc{3}, \ros{1}, fails to favour without \fc{1}.

  To motivate the existence of \requ{1}, \tC{}.

  Link these together.

  This is it.

  Counter-samples.

  Nothing assumes counterexamples exist.
  Instead, when these combine to form a \scen{}.

  Close with some additional stuff.

\begin{note}
  Hindsight, somewhat intuitive.

  Sleight of hand.
  Distinction between sleight of hand and a bad shuffle.
  May be the case that agent tenses hand so that bottom card stays in position and then place on top to finish the shuffle.

  Sleight of hand, then other cards.

  \ros{}, general.
  Factorisation.
  In parallel to shuffle, other instances.
  Without these, nothing to ensure factorisation over brewing number soup.

\section*{Notes}


\begin{note}
  Quick notes:

  First, I hold explanatory reasons are factive, and I think that answers to \qWhy{} reduce to psychological facts of an agent, specifically psychological facts which hold of the agent when they conclude.%
  % \footnote{
  %   This is in slight tension with views of reasons explanation advanced by~(\cite{Dancy:2000aa}) and~(\cite{Alvarez:2013aa}), in which the state of affairs may be an agent's reason (and not just the evaluation of some state of affairs).
  %   Though, the argument will not depend on assuming that the relations reduce to psychological facts.

  %   See~(\cite[413--418]{Hieronymi:2011aa}),~(\cite[3--5]{DOro:2013vh}), and~(\cite[\S2]{Alvarez:2017aa}) for more.
  % }

  Given what I hold and think, from a very broad perspective, \issueInclusion{} is a restriction on which psychological facts of an agent matter when an agent concludes:

  If \issueInclusion{} holds, the only facts which matter are those which secure the \ros{} between \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\).

  And, if \issueInclusion{} fails, facts other than those which secure the \ros{} between \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\) matter, specifically, facts which secure some \ros{} between \(\phi\), \(v\), and \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

% \begin{note}
%   As seen above with respect to \autoref{scen:animalism}, it follows from \issueInclusion{} that the content of Snowball's explanation is irrelevant.
%   For, the birds do not understand Snowball's explanation, hence there is no event in which the birds reason from the content to \propI{Four legs good, two legs bad} has value \valI{True}.
%   And, I think this is correct.

%   However, parallel reasoning entails the agent's understanding of arithmetic is irrelevant with respect to \autoref{scen:calc}.
%   And, I do not think this entailment holds.
%   I think it may be the case that a relation between \propM{\gistCalcEq{}}, \valI{True} and the agent's understanding of arithmetic \emph{may} answer \qWhy{}.
%   Whether this is the case will depend on whether some additional details hold of~\autoref{scen:calc}.
%   Still, as the details matter, the entailment, and hence \issueInclusion{}, is not right.
% \end{note}

\begin{note}
  Still, there is distinction between psychological facts and the exercise of agency.
  To illustrate, there a senses in which the following two questions are distinct:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{Why} is \(e\) is an event in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\)?
  \item
    \emph{Why} is it the case \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) in \(e\)?
  \end{itemize}

  Consider \citeauthor{Davidson:1973vd}'s climber:
  %
  \begin{quote}
    A climber might want to rid himself of the weight and danger of holding another man on a rope, and he might know that by loosening his hold on the rope he could rid himself of the weight and danger.
    This belief and want might so unnerve him as to cause him to loosen his hold, and yet it might be the case that he never chose to loosen his hold, nor did he do it intentionally.%
    \mbox{ }\hfill\mbox{(\citeauthor[79]{Davidson:1973vd})}
  \end{quote}
  %
  The \agents{} belief and want are psychological facts about the agent, and answer why \emph{the event} is an event in which the agent loosens their hold on the rope.
  However, the \agents{} belief and want do not answer why \emph{the agent} loosens their hold on the rope.
  Indeed, there seems no answer to why the agent loosens their hold on the rope --- the act was not an exercise of agency.

  \citeauthor{Davidson:1973vd}'s climber does not conclude.
  Still, if an agent may loosen their grip without exercising their agency, it is seems plausible that a \ros{} between \(\psi\), \(v'\) and \(\Psi\) which answers why is \emph{\(e\) is an event} in which \vAgent{} concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) may fail to answer why is it the case the agent concludes \(\phi\) has value \(v\) in \(e\).

  In short, it is not clear that any counterexample to \issueInclusion{} relates to an exercise of agency.
  Whether this matters is for you to decide.
  On some days I think this matters a great deal, and on other days I doubt there is any coherent idea of what an exercise of agency amounts to.

  We set concerns about agency aside for the argument against \issueInclusion{}, and then motivate that relevant counterexamples either involve agency or have nearby neighbours which involve agency.

%     Sometimes the explanation of why a person does something has a particular character:
%     roughly, it involves the person's rationality in a distinctive way that I shall not try to describe.
%     Then we say the person does what she does for a reason.
%     We might say ‘The reason for which Hannibal used elephants was to terrorize the Romans'.
%     The reason for which a person does something is called a ‘motivating reason'.
%     In general, a motivating reason is whatever explains or helps to explain what a person does in the distinctive way that involves her rationality.

%   \begin{quote}
%     \emph{R} is a primary reason why an agent performed the action \emph{A} under the description \emph{d} only if \emph{R} consists of a pro attitude of the agent toward actions with a certain property, and a belief of the agent that \emph{A}, under the description \emph{d}, has that property.\newline

%   We have distinguished \qWhy{} from pro-attitudes.
%   However, fill in whatever motivation.
%   What matters is the belief.
%   This is the relevant proposition-value pair.

%   If \citeauthor{Davidson:1963aa}, then granting restriction, seems we don't need to look beyond the proposition-value pair.
