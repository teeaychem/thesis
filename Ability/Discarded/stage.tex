  \begin{definition}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \(e^{\flat}\) is an \emph{omen} of \(e\).
    \end{itemize}
    If and only if:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The following conditional is true:
      \begin{itenum}
      \item[\emph{If}:]
        \(e^{\flat}\) is, or develops into, \(e\).
      \item[\emph{Then}:]
        \(e^{\flat}\) is an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \end{itenum}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{definition}

  So, here, it needs to be the case that the agent is concluding.
  Suppose agent is not concluding.
  Then, not in progress.

  

  Simple example here is resources.
  Reasoning takes time.


  \begin{itenum}
  \item[\emph{If}:]
    \(e^{\flat}\) is not an event in which \vAgent{} is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  \item[\emph{Then}:]
    \(e^{\flat}\) is not, or does not develop into, \(e\).
  \end{itenum}
