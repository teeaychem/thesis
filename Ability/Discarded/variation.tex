\chapter{\qWhyV{} and \qHowV{}}
\label{cha:var}


\begin{note}
  We have now detailed the way in which we understand conclusions (\autoref{cha:clar}) and \ros{} (\autoref{cha:ros}).
  The present chapter returns to \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{} (\autoref{cha:intro}).

  The function of this chapter is to summarise and simplify \qWhy{}, \qHow{}, and \issueInclusion{}.
  The first section 
  

  At the close of the chapter variant questions to \qWhy{} and \qHow{} will have been stated (\qWhyV{} and \qHowV{}, respectively) and a our attention will turn to counterexamples to a constraints between the variant questions which parallels \issueInclusion{} (\issueConstraint{}).

\section{\qWhyV{}}
\label{cha:var:qwhyvnp}


\paragraph*{Observation}


\begin{note}
  \begin{observation}%
    \label{obs:qWhyV:rosNNecAns}%
    A \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) may answer \qWhyV{} though the \ros{} is unrelated to why \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) follows from \(\Phi\) from the \agpe{\agents{}}.
  \end{observation}

  \begin{motivation}{obs:qWhyV:rosNNecAns}
    Consider a \scen{0} in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) where partway through the agent concludes to brew a cup of tea.

    It may well be the case that the agent fails to conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) without the aid of the tea.
    For, without a warm cup of reassurance, the agent gives up.
    and, if so, a \ros{} between \pv{\propI{Brew a cup of tea}}{\valI{Do}} and some \pool{} \(\Psi\) answers \qWhyV{}.

    Still, from the \agpe{\agents{}}, the cup of tea was only a nice thing to have.
  \end{motivation}

  \noindent%
  Intuitively it is not be the case that the \ros{} and the conclusion to get some tea answers why \emph{the agent} concluded some theorem is true from some \pool{}.%
  \footnote{
    \citeauthor{Armstrong:1968vh} (\citeyear[195--196]{Armstrong:1968vh}) discusses a similar example, and suggests further discussion of this issue may also be found in \textcite{Moore:1962up}.
    See also \citeauthor{Sanford:1989aa} (\citeyear{Sanford:1989aa}) for a discussion of dependence as captured by subjunctive conditions (esp.\ pp.\ 192--193).
  }

  Still, \qWhy{} and \qWhyV{} concern the way in which an event in which an agent concludes develops, and various \ros{} which hold during an event when an agent concludes may answer this.

  Note, however, it must be the case that a \ros{} is required to hold in order for a \se{} to be a event in which the agent is concluding.
  Hence, a \ros{} between \pv{\propI{Brew a cup of coffee}}{\valI{Do}} and some \pool{} \(\Psi'\) does not answer \qWhyV{} as the agent concluded to get tea, rather than coffee (and even if the choice between tea and coffee was a figurative coin flip).
  And, a \ros{} between \pv{\propI{Brew a cup of tea}}{\valI{Do}} and \(\Psi\) fails to answer \qWhyV{} if the agent may have concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) without the aid of the cup of tea.
\end{note}


\section{\issueConstraint{}}
\label{cha:var:issue}

\begin{note}
  A constraint between \qWhyV{} and \qHowV{} follows from \linkW{}, \linkH{}, and \issueInclusion{}:

  \begin{proposition}[\qWhyV{}-\qWhy{}-\qHow{}-\qHowV{}]%
    \label{prop:support-and-witnessing}%
    \linkW{}, \linkH{}, and \issueInclusion{} (jointly) entail the following conditional:
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      A \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) is an answer to \qWhyV{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      An event \(\ed{\prime}\) which \wit[es]{0} a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qHowV{}.
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{argument}{prop:support-and-witnessing}
    Suppose \qWhyV{} is answered, in part, by a \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\).
    Then:

    By~\linkW{} the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{}.
    So, by \issueInclusion{}, an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) answers \qHow{}.
    And finally, by \linkH{}, the event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) answers \qHowV{}.
  \end{argument}
\end{note}


% \begin{note}
%   \color{blue}
%   Intuitively, given an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) then a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhy{} and the event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) answers \qHow{}.
%   Hence, it should be the case that a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhyV{} and the event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) answers \qHowV{}.
%   This is the case:

%   \begin{proposition}[Sanity check]%
%     \label{prop:vSantity}%
%     \vspace{-\baselineskip}
%     \begin{itenum}
%     \item[\emph{If}:]
%       \(\ed{}\) is an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) as a result of concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) where \fc{}.
%     \item[\emph{Then}]
%       Conditions \ref{prop:vSantity:why} and \ref{prop:vSantity:how} both hold:
%       \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., ref=\arabic*]
%       \item
%         \label{prop:vSantity:why}%
%         A \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) answers \qWhyV{}.
%       \item
%         \label{prop:vSantity:how}%
%         An event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) is always an answer to \qHowV{}.
%       \end{enumerate}
%     \end{itenum}
%     \vspace{-\baselineskip}
%   \end{proposition}

%   \begin{argument}{prop:vSantity}
%     \(\ed{}\) is an event in which an agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) as a result of concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

%     As the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) as a result of concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) there is an event in which the agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

%     Take \(\ed{\flat}\) as an event in which the agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

%     \(\ed{\flat}\) is a \se{} of \(\ed{}\).
%     For, \(\ed{}\) is in progress and \(\ed{}\) happens as a result of \(\ed{\flat}\).

%     Further, \(\ed{\flat}\) is in progress \emph{only if} a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) holds throughout \(\ed{\flat}\).
%     For, by \supportII{} a \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) must hold if \(\ed{\flat}\) is an event in which the agent is concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

%     Hence, the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) answers \qWhyV{}.

%     \medskip

%     Now, \(\ed{}\) is an event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
%     Hence, \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) and \(\Phi\) answers \qWhyV{}.
%   \end{argument}
% \end{note}


\begin{note}
  \autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} constrains answers to \qWhyV{} in terms of answers to \qHowV{}.
  Hence, we reformulate \autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} as a constraint that parallels \issueInclusion{}:

  \begin{constraint}{consConstraint}{\issueConstraint{}}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    \begin{itenum}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      A \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) answers \qWhyV{}.
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \vAgent{} has a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) when \vAgent{} concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    \end{itenum}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
  \end{constraint}

  \noindent%
  The remainder of the document focuses on (counterexamples to) \issueConstraint{}.
  For, if there are counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}, then by \autoref{prop:support-and-witnessing} either \linkW{}, \linkH{}, or \issueInclusion{} fails to hold.

  I take \linkH{} to be trivial, and \linkW{} to be sufficiently well-motivated by \progEx{}.
  So, if \issueConstraint{} fails to hold then \issueInclusion{} fails to hold.
\end{note}



\section*{Summary}

\begin{note}
  This chapter introduced \qWhyV{} and \qHowV{} as variants to \qWhy{} and \qHow{}, respectively.
  The benefit of \qWhyV{} and \qHowV{} (over \qWhy{} and \qHow{}) is a clear account of answers to \qWhyV{} and \qHowV{}.
  In particular, we get a detailed argument for an answer to \qWhyV{} with respect to \autoref{illu:gist:roots:F}.

  Further, we observed a constraint on answers to \qWhyV{} in terms of answers to \qHowV{} follows from \issueInclusion{}.
  So, if you like, you may now forget about \qWhy{} and \qHow{} and \issueInclusion{}.
  The remainder of this document focuses on (counterexamples to) \issueConstraint{}.

% \footnote{
% \phantlabel{fn:past-witness}
% To illustrate, consider an agent working on some mathematical problem.

% As part of their work on the problem the agent concludes the hypotenuse of some right-angled triangle is \(\sqrt{74}\text{cm}\) by use of the Pythagorean theorem.
% Further, the agent has, at some point in the past proved the Pythagorean theorem from more basic principles.

% Perhaps the agent concludes the hypotenuse of the triangle is \(\sqrt{74}\text{cm}\), in part, from those more basic principles.
% Perhaps in general it is true that if a agent concluded \(X\) from \(Y\) and \(Y\) from \(Z\), then the agent, in part at least, concluded \(X\) from \(Z\).
% On the other hand perhaps the more basic principles have no role explanatory role in the present.
% The agent only appealed to the theorem, rather than any basic principles.

% Though we will not take a stand on whether a relevant \wit{0} for some conclusion is distinct from the event in which the agent concludes, the first option highlights an issue with \autoref{def:witnessing}.
% Consider an agent working through a proof of some theorem \(\theta\), and let \(\Theta\) be the relevant \pool{}.
% Our interest is with the conclusion \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).

% Suppose the agent reasons to \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
% Further, suppose the \agents{} reasoning is sound.
% However, the agent is worried about some parts of their reasoning.
% Hence, given their worries, \emph{reasons} to --- but does not conclude --- \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
% Some time later the agent resolves their worries and concludes the theorem is true.
% I see no issue with the possibility that:
%   % 
% \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
% \item
%   When the agent revisited the proof, they concluded \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
% \item
%   In part, a \ros{} between \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) and \(\Theta\), from the \agpe{}, answers why the agent concluded \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\).
% \item
%   The event in which the agent reasoned to \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\) answers, in part, how the agent \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\) by being a \wit{} for the \ros{} between \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) and \(\Theta\).
% \end{itemize}
%   % 
% However, the idea is incompatible with the way a \wit{0} is understood.
% For, by the definition, an event which is a \wit{0} must be an event in which the agent \emph{concludes}.
% And, by construction of the \scen{0}, the \agents{} worries prevent the agent from forming the relevant conclusion.

% Perhaps \autoref{def:witnessing} should be revised so that an event \(\ed{\prime}\) may be \wit{} so long as the agent adequately reasons (an optionally concludes).
%   % However, providing an adequate characterisation of the relevant event is difficult.
%   % That the agent \emph{reasoned} to \(\pv{\theta}{\valI{True}}\) from \(\Theta\) is insufficient.
%   % 
%   % For example, consider a variation of the \scen{} in which the agent identifies a problem with the proof.
%   % Given the presence of a problem, there may be no \ros{} for the agent to have a \wit{0} for.
% Still,
%   % rather than attempt to characterise \ros{1} independently of conclusions,
% we keep the present definition of a \wit{} for simplicity.
