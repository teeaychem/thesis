\begin{note}[Intro, locating]
  Our goal motivate a negative resolution to~\issueConstraint{}.

  \autoref{cha:fcs}, \fc{1}.

  Goal of the present chapter is foundations to link \fc{1} to concluding.

  Split into three main sections.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=]
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:zS:sec:lost-keys}.

    Two \scen{1}, \TNSketch{1} of the core phenomena, and breakdown of the \TNSketch{1}.
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:zS:sec:curbs}

    The idea of \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) being (partial) \check{} on concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
    Term we give is `\curb{}'.
  \item
    \TOCLine{cha:zS:sec:requs}

    Connecting the idea of a \curb{} to \ros{}, and hence establishing the structure for counterexamples to \issueConstraint{}.
  \end{enumerate}
