\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  Okay, to keep things straightforward.
  The point of putting this after \autoref{cha:zSpA} is so that there's no confusion with relations of support.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  We're almost done.

  \qzS{}.
  Answers to \qzS{}.

  In \autoref{cha:zSpA}, looked at positive answers to \qzS{}.
  Argued potential event.
  In particular, that \ptivity{} must hold for any positive answer.
  In other words, potential event without qualification, from the agent's perspective.

  Of course, from the agent's perspective.
  And, the agent's perspective is a qualifier.
  In particular, non-factive.
  So, does not follow that there is a potential event.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, we've got how potential events are linked to answers to \qzS{}.

  Second part of the argument.
  Answers to \qzS{} and \qWhyV{}.

\section{Propositions}
\label{cha:zSpAwhy:sec:proposition}

\begin{note}
  Proposition for this chapter.

  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:fc-answers-why}
    For an agent \vAgent{}, \(\pv{\phi}{v}\), \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\):

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{If}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*)]
      \item \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \requ{} of concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{And}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume]
      \item
        \vAgent{} concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{And}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume]
      \item
        \qzS{} has positive answer when concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
      \end{enumerate}
    \item[\emph{Then}:]
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., ref=(\alph*), resume]
      \item
        \support{2} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\), in part, answers \qWhyV{}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proposition}
  In other words, the potential event in which the agent concludes \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\), in part, answers \qWhyV{} the agent concluded \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{proposition}
    If \fc{} is embedded in \support{}, then instance of \qzS{}.
  \end{proposition}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Would not conclude without support.

  Answer this in two steps.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Would not conclude unless \fc{}.
  \item
    \fc{} only if \support{}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{note}

\section{\fc{3} and \support{0}}
\label{sec:fc3-support0}

\begin{note}

  \begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:fc-RoS}
    \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \fc{} \emph{only if} a relation of support holds between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\), from the agent's perspective.
  \end{proposition}

  The argument for \autoref{prop:fc-RoS} is {\color{red} mostly immediate for ideas regarding support}.

  \begin{proposition}
    If conclude only if \fc{}, then support, in part, answers \qWhyV{}.
  \end{proposition}

  So, to get answer to \qWhyV{}, need dependency.
  Here, if not \support{} then not \fc{}.
  If not \fc{} then not conclude.

  This is fine, just need to be careful with the counterfactual.
  Relation between \support{} and \fc{} is plain conditional.
  So, it survives any counterfactual changes.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, need to get conclude only if \fc{}.
\end{note}

\section{\fc{3} and why}
\label{sec:fc3-why}

\begin{note}
  Interested in particular \fc{1}.
  Those arising from \qzS{}.

  Split this into two parts.

  First part, answers to \qzS{}.
  Second part, instances of \qzS{}.

  First part allows taking all the examples of instances of \qzS{} at face value.
  Second part allows for possibility of avoiding instances of \qzS{} by embedding \fc{1}, somehow.
  Key is, instances of \qzS{} arise, so long as \fc{}.
\end{note}

\subsection{Part I}
\label{sec:simple-argument}

\begin{note}
  Intuitively, \autoref{prop:fc-answers-why} follows from how \qzS{} relates to concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).

  For, the way things are set up.
  \qzS{} is about the act of concluding.
  Therefore, answer \qzS{}, is tied to concluding, and so \support{} answers \qWhyV{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Now, key observation is that \requ{} of concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
  \qzS{} is about this instance of concluding.

  Regardless of whether embedded, whether conclude from \(\Phi\).

  Think back to \requ{}.
  Would not conclude otherwise.
  If not \fc{}, then may conclude otherwise.
  Hence, may \deadEnd{} \support{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{observation}
    Relation of support holds between pool of premises and a conclusion.
  \end{observation}
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Relation of support is an interesting thing.
  It holds between pool of premises and a conclusion.
  This answers \qWhy{}.

  Initial observation, then, is that some care should be given to what we get.
  There's a difference between a relation between pool and a proposition, and relation between pool of propositions and an event.

  Understanding is that relation between pool and proposition-value answers, in part, why an event took place.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Now, \qzS{} is about the event taking place.
  \qzS{} is not (directly) about whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\), but about the event of concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  So, in a naive way, we would only get a relation of support between \fc{} and \(\pvp{\phi}{v}{\Phi}\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  At issue with \qzS{} is \emph{not}:

  If agent were to fail to hold that you would conclude \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) from \(\Psi\) as \emph{a premise}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Note, the tension is not about whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Instead, the tension is about whether the agent would have a certain property if they were to conclude \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  \zS{}.
  Expanded, property of holding that any independent check is satisfied.
  For any \requ{}, would not fail to conclude.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  This is the plain reading.

  I think the plain reading is appropriate.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Aside]
  Note, this is part of what I find appealing about a positive resolution to \issueConstraint{} and concluding, etc.

  When concluding, we're interested in how to go from premises to conclusion.
  The relevant content of the premises is distinguished from relation which holds between premises and conclusion.

  The way in which content relates, rather than content itself.

  To elaborate.
  Conclusion is \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
  Now, \(\pv{\chi}{v''}\) is in part an answer to why \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) is the case from the agent's perspective.
  However, not, in part, an answer to why agent concluded, from agent's perspective.
  For, concluding, what matters is relation of support between pool of premises containing \(\pv{\chi}{v''}\) and \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Task is to show that \qzS{} is not answered.
\end{note}

\subsection{Part II}
\label{sec:flexible-argument}

\begin{note}
  The problem is whether this reading is so straightforward.

  The issue is, whether the relevant issue may be raised in a way such that don't get an instance of \qzS{}.

  Idea is, agent concludes \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) in part from positive answer to weaker variant of \qzS{}.
  If so, then it looks as though what should matter is \support{} from positive answer to \(\pv{\phi}{v}\).

  Recall, from \autoref{cha:clarification:sec:embedding}.
  Embedding.
  If \support{} from positive answer then \support{} is embedded.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Target of flexible argument is embeddings of \fc{}.

  \begin{proposition}
    If \fc{} is embedded in \support{}, then plausible \requ{}
  \end{proposition}

  \begin{proposition}
    If \requ{} then instance of \qzS{} which applies to present instance of concluding.
  \end{proposition}

  The argument for this is simple, really.
  For, back to the idea of \deadEnd{1}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Now, \deadEnd{1} allow easy construction of a \requ{}.
  Why is it the case that this matters from the agent's perspective?
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  Type of \requ{1} generated are different.
  In the basic motivating cases, ability.
  It's the same reasoning.
  Here, it may be distinct way of reasoning.
  However, remains a \requ{}.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  The problem arising from recursion is that there's no positive answer.
  And, as soon as you grant a positive answer, there's no need for the recursion.
\end{note}

\newpage

\subsection{Abstract}
\label{cha:zSpAwhy:sec:argument:abstract}

\begin{note}
  \color{red}
  Question is not about whether \(\phi\) has value \(v\).
  Question is about whether the agent would perform the act.

  So, embedding, fails to answer why performed the act.

  Assume embedding.

  Relation of support between pool of premises and conclusion.

  So, in this case, the relation is between the \fc{} and the conclusion.

  However, this can't be right.
  What is at issue is not the conclusion, but the act of concluding.

  This is the basic idea.

  Though, this is not immediate, because it's possible to embed answers.
  So, then it turns to getting the \requ{} again.
  This doesn't depend on a recursion principle, only the observation that an agent may reasonably view the \requ{} reapplying.

  What is of some interest here is that it's the same \requ{}.
  What changes is the concluding  that it applies to.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item By assumption, positive answer to \qzS{} matters.
  \item And, by assumption, no witnessing.
  \item So, \support{} between \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) and \(\Psi\) isn't direct.
  \item Therefore, \support{} is embedded.
  \item No assumptions about the `depth' of embedding.
  \item However, it remains the case that \qzS{} holds.
  \item The distinction used here is the problem.
  \item We've just expanded the pool.
  \item Make this a little clearer by isolating.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) is a \fc{} and \(\Psi\), therefore \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\).
    \item \(\pvp{\psi}{v'}{\Psi}\) as a \requ{}.
    \item At issue is not whether \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) follows from \(\pv{\psi}{v'}\) being a \fc{}.
    \item Rather, at issue is whether \(\pv{\psi}{v'}{\Phi}\) \emph{is} a \fc{}.
    \item Note, in this case, if you define \(\Psi = \Psi \cup{ \fc{} }\) then the relevant \requ{} is without the \fc{}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\paragraph{As a premise\dots}

\begin{note}
  Now, how to get to \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from this is a further issue.

  Though, I don't think it is implausible.

  For example.

  Witnessed reasoning.
  Pair with conclusion.

  In this case, conclude \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi^{+}\), where \(\Phi^{+}\) includes the option.

  So, in this respect, intermediate conclusion.
  Concluding \(\pv{\phi}{v}\) from \(\Phi\) in part involves concluding that \qzS{} has a positive answer.
  I mean, further, then, the relation of support is embedded twice.
\end{note}


\paragraph{Ah!}

\begin{note}
  So, here we have the problem.
  Still have issue of \requ{}.

  Really, it's about the reasoning.

  If you grant there are cases in which \qzS{} matters, and hold to inclusion, then an additional \requ{}.
\end{note}

\subsection{Summarising}
\label{sec:summarising}

\paragraph{Recursive?}

\begin{note}
  Well, to the extent \citeauthor{Carroll:1895uj} seems to be.

  For, break out of the loop at any time.
  There's nothing to prevent the Tortoise from accepting.
